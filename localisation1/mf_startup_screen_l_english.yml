 #Roman Europe and Africa
 string_start_byz_476:0 "The Western Roman Empire has fallen to the barbarian tribes. Although §YJulius Nepos§! continues to claim the imperial throne in Rome as its de jure ruler, the emperor of the Byzantine Empire, §YZeno the Isaurian§!, is now the de-facto and sole Emperor of what remains of the Roman Empire.\n\nHaving just quashed §YBasiliscus’ revolt§!, Emperor Zeno is now met with a completely different political situation. Receiving an envoy from the Senate of Rome, Zeno officially names the barbarian chieftain §YOdoacer§! the patricius and governor of Italia. In the west, other barbarian tribes consolidate their territories as new kingdoms, while the Sassanid empire remains a threat in the east.\n\nThough the western empire has fallen, the Roman Empire is united once more."
 string_start_row_476:0 "The foederati officer §YOdoacer§! has overthrown the Emperor §YRomulus Augustus§! of the Western Roman Empire and insolently declared himself the King of §YItaly§!. Although Romulus Augustus had wrongly usurped the throne from our emperor-in-exile §YJulius Nepos§!, who was forced to flee to Dalmatia just a year earlier, two wrongs do not make a right. Though our troops are few and our supplies and resources limited, our glorious Emperor Julius Nepos refuses to submit to the barbarians, unlike the cowardly senators in Rome who were so quick to kneel to the impudent Odoacer. Thus, with the backing of Emperor §YZeno§! of the §YByzantine Empire§!, our rightful Emperor Julius Nepos now fights to return to Rome and reclaim his rightful empire from the barbarian traitors!"
 string_start_ita_476:0 "The foederati officer §YFlavius Odoacer§! has overthrown the Western Roman Emperor §YRomulus Augustus§!, officially bringing an end to the decaying Western Roman Empire. Having gained the allegiance of the §YRoman Senate§!, Odoacer uses them to acquire recognition from Emperor §YZeno§! of the Byzantine Empire as the official governor of Italy. Although now formally a patrician under Zeno’s rule in Constantinople, in reality Odoacer has become a fully-autonomous and de-facto King of §YItaly§!.\n\nHowever, our king cannot relax on his throne just yet, as strong Germanic kingdoms on all sides threaten his throne in Ravenna: the §YOstrogoths§! led by the ambitious §YTheodoric§! to the east; the §YVisigoths§! in Hispania to the west; and the §YVandals§! ruling over Carthage and Sicily in the south. Furthermore, Emperor Zeno could turn against Odoacer at any moment should the latter be deemed a threat to Byzantine rule."
 string_start_van_476:0 "The §YVandal§! tribe migrated from Germania proper to Hispania and Mauretania, and in 439 the Vandals captured the city of §YCarthage§!, the most important Roman city in north Africa and the breadbasket of the Roman Empire. To make matters worse, the Vandals engaged in piracy in the Mediterranean, and in 455 the Vandals continued their plunder and sacked the once-glorious city of §YRome§! itself, taking all of its riches back to Carthage.\n\nHaving dealt these crushing blows to the already-crumbling §YWest Rome§!, it was no surprise to the Vandal king §YGenseric§! that the fragile empire had fallen. With Roman lands now ruled by the very people the Romans had called ‘barbarians’, this was an opportunity for Genseric to oppose the Christian orthodoxy set in place by the Romans and spread the true faith of §YArianism§! throughout the land… and perhaps plunder the world’s riches along the way!"
 string_start_van_pre_439:0 "The Kingdom of §YAltava§!, also known as the Kingdom of the Romans and Moors, has survived the chaos leading up to the fall of §YWest Rome§!. Having maintained a degree of autonomy under Roman rule, local Berber rulers soon rose up against Rome once the latter began to fall apart from the inside, and the Altavan kingdom quickly emerged as a major power in Mauretania.\n\nAltava exists as a Roman rump state in Mauretania, and has even expanded into lands that were never under Roman rule. Altava continues to maintain diplomatic relations with the Eastern Roman Empire, though our kingdom has become increasingly isolated as local tribes and kingdoms threaten Mauro-Roman sovereignty in Altava."

The Mauro-Roman peoples are repeatedly forced to war with the neighboring kingdom of the §YVandals§! in Carthage; although the Berbers had initially supported the Vandals against Roman rule, the two became major enemies fighting for suzerainty over north Africa."
