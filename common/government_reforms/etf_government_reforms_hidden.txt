# This is a nifty lil' thing I discovered while experimenting, hidden government reforms!

# These do not occupy any slot in the Gov. Reform window, meaning an arbitrary amount of them could be tacked on to a
# given country without overriding each other.
# They can only be removed via effect or changing government, potential and trigger doesn't do anything.
# They seem to have a higher "priority" than government basic reforms but lower priority than normal reforms, in regards
# to effects and gov. mechanics.

# Thinking of potential use-cases of these; modifiers that automatically expire on changing government?
# Could you use them as an expanded alternative to normal country modifiers, with government mechanics built-in?
