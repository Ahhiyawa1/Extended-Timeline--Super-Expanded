Furthermore, tanists must be in good physical condition, have no physical or mental blemishes, and must be of full adulthood. The election of the tanist allows for the balance of power between the various cadet branches of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], though many times the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s eldest son may be chosen if he meets the requirements."

It is also common that extra sons and daughters who could not be married are instead sent to these monasteries so they would not threaten the inheritance of the older children.

While such pious service as an abbot is admirable and well-respected, with some royal family members even being granted sainthood after living a devout life in the monasteries, this son in particular had been sent there primarily to avoid succession issues upon the vacancy of the throne.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that the fears of the late ruler have come true regardless of this move. Hearing that our new ruler [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has ascended the throne, the forgotten son has now rallied an army of supporters and sympathizers and challenges [Root.Monarch.GetName] for dominion over the [Root.GetAdjective] realm."

Claiming he was visited by Laozi himself, who bestowed upon him the title of Tianshi, or 'Celestial Master,' Zhang Ling has amassed a large number of followers in the region thanks to his focus on health and practices for the purpose of long life.\n\nHis influence is so great that he has founded his own autonomous theocratic state in Shu known as the Way of Five Pecks of Rice, named after the tax levied on his followers - this is likely the most organized form of Daoism in the history of the Middle Kingdom. Should we face more troubled times, we could very well see the widespread diffusion of this sect of Daoism across western and northern China as more become disillusioned with Confucianism and the social harmony promised by Confucius' teachings."

With the Daoists of the city more loyal to the Celestial Master and his teachings than our own government and ruler, our de facto authority in the city is now at threat. While we could persecute the sect, perhaps we could utilize the sect to our advantage and instead win their favor and manpower by officially recognizing their Tianshi Daoist school, which in the process would grant them protected state status."

Because of thus, an increasing number of intellectuals and officials have turned away from the Confucian ideals sponsored by our state and now favor the philosophy of the Daoists. Confucians and Daoists have shared and exchanged many ideas over the generations, there is no denying that a rivalry still exists between the two schools, especially if supporting one means doubting our divine authority.\n\nRecently, [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] has taken an interest in Daoism and surrounded himself with an inner circle of Daoist intellectuals. While it is fair for our heir to take an interest in the various classic schools of thought, allowing [Root.Heir.GetName] to side with the Daoists may potentially undermine the very ideological foundation of our state."

While his services may be useful to our state, in some cases wise men are best left outside the realm of government, as he like many Daoists likely view our governance as unnatural and thus antithetical to the Dao."

One Daoist text has become especially popular among scholars and other educated groups - while it critiques government institutions as a whole, we have found several instances in which the book implies flaws in our own government and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.8.desc:0 "While Daoism grew popular during Confucianism's decline, another faith that benefited from this trend is Buddhism, with more and more of our people identifying as Buddhists each day. As a result, many of its practices have influenced even followers of Daoism. One of these influences is Buddhist monasticism, as several Neo-Daoists have identified with the values and practices of Buddhist monks.\n\nSome adherants of Daoism have already opted for a monastic lifestyle, constructing monasteries and practicing celibacy, the latter of which is already valued in traditional Daoism as the preservation of qi in one's body. While we have accepted influences from other Schools of Thought in the past, such as Confucianism and Mohism, we view Buddhism as a largely foreign entity, and some Daoist scholars are concerned that accepting too many influences will remove our identity as true Daoists."

Because of her iron grip, she gained the admiration of women but the ire of high-ranking men; when she was attending a funeral, Arawelo was killed by a warlord named Oday Biqay.\n\nToday, the tomb of Arawelo is an important site in our history. Thanks to her now legendary status in our culture and history, many women travel to Arawelo's gravesite to lay flowers; on the other hand, men who pass by the site throw rocks on her tomb.

We could give her what she requests along with supplies and allow her to return to her home, where she will continue to positively influence the countryside - on the other hand, we could instead offer to recruit her as a court priest so she may provide her religious services and wisdom in the capital."

However, one especially-prominent Qaalluu that was previously well-respected by many was caught in an immoral scandal. Many are calling for their resignation from their role as a priest, though the loss of an influential figure would not be ideal for those of the Qaalluu institution who was associated with this scandalous Qaalluu, whose image may be stained in the eyes of the public for quite some time."

mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.6.desc:0 "The Qaalluu institution, our priesthood, is expected to remain politically neutral in all cases so that all deliberations and rituals shall be performed with utmost fairness. While it is inevitable that a religious institution shall diffuse into the realm of politics, the Qaalluu are expected to treat both sides equally, except in cases of obvious tyranny.\n\nRecently, an especially prominent Qaalluu overstepped his role, vehemently and passionately defending the actions of one faction in our realm. While impassioned rhetoric would be expected among the noble and merchant classes, such strong bias is unbecoming of the Qaalluu. While not cause for any sort of resignation or exile, it may be our role as temporal leaders to step in and set things straight."

The popularity of Mithra as a divine figure is so great that the Zoroastrians of the Achaemenid period eventually embraced Mithra as the divinity second only to Ahura Mazda, the supreme deity in the Mazdaist Zoroastrianism promoted by the Achaemenids. Thus, the Mithraic religion within our borders is not necessarily a separate faith, but instead a form of Zoroastrianism in which Mithra takes center."
