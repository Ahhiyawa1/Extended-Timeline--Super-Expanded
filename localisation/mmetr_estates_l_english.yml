estate_eunuchs:0 "Eunuchs"
estate_eunuchs_desc:0 "Highly trusted by the royal family due to their inability to have offspring, the eunuchs take care of the royal household. However, due to their close ties with the royalty, they hold great influence in the court, and may even override the court officials themselves. Thus, it is important for our lord to place trust in virtuous eunuchs while limiting the power of more ambitious eunuch factions in the court."

estate_eunuchs_land_rights:0 "$ESTATE_NAME$ Land Rights"
estate_eunuchs_land_rights_desc:0 "Though eunuchs were first simply servants in the court, the level of trust they had with their emperors as well as their closeness with the imperial family granted them great influence; rather than just being court attendants, they could become part of the influential landowning elite."
estate_eunuchs_noble_titles:0 "Eunuch Noble Titles"
estate_eunuchs_noble_titles_desc:0 "Though the eunuchs are not noble-born, they may be granted noble titles for exceptional service - or perhaps through more unscrupulous means. Granting such noble titles to eunuchs decreases the influence of the nobles, most of which would already have to submit a request for meeting with the emperor to the eunuchs themselves."
estate_eunuchs_inner_circle:0 "Create an Inner Circle"
estate_eunuchs_inner_circle_desc:0 "As the eunuchs are among the most trusted attendants of the court, it is likely that the creation of any sort of inner circle of advisors and friends of the ruler would be comprised entirely of their closest eunuchs."
estate_eunuchs_limit_rights_to_counsel:0 "Limit Counsel Rights"
estate_eunuchs_limit_rights_to_counsel_desc:0 "The eunuch's place as palace attendants has made them influential advisors. However, this level of influence can be dangerous, so setting clear boundaries on their role in the court may be useful for preventing potential corruption."
estate_eunuchs_bureaucracy:0 "Eunuch Bureaucracy"
estate_eunuchs_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The eunuchs already play a large role in state affairs - thus, we could grant them the ability to create their own bureaucracy, operating within the capital independent of the state's."
estate_eunuchs_command_palace_guard:0 "Command of the Palace Guard"
estate_eunuchs_command_palace_guard_desc:0 "To combat the rebels that threaten the throne, a palace army can be established. And who could be better trusted to command these soldiers but those who cannot have children, and thus cannot have a dynasty to challenge our ruler?"
estate_eunuchs_royal_tutor:0 "Imperial Tutors"
estate_eunuchs_royal_tutor_desc:0 "Since the eunuchs are already in charge of attending to the needs of the empress, concubines and children of the emperor, we may as well give them the ability to tutor our heirs so they may become capable rulers in their own right."

estate_holy_orders_land_rights_desc:0 "Allowing the Holy Orders to run portions of our domain will not only cut costs of maintenance and administration but also allow for the further development of lands far from the capital without exhausting our treasury."
estate_holy_orders_financial_control:0 "Financial Control"
estate_holy_orders_financial_control_desc:0 "The holy orders were among the first innovators of financial exchange and banking, and are thus especially skilled in managing coin through their vast economic networks across Christendom. Thus, it may be wise for us to heed their advice and perhaps even place our finances in their pious hands."
estate_holy_orders_letters_of_credit:0 "Letters of Credit"
estate_holy_orders_letters_of_credit_desc:0 "Some of the holy orders such as the Knights Templar have been known for issuing letters of credit to pilgrims journeying to the Holy Land, after which they would receive their promised funds upon arriving in the Holy Land. Allowing them to issue letters of credit on a broader scale within our lands may also be beneficial for us."
estate_holy_orders_holy_knights:0 "Holy Knights"
estate_holy_orders_holy_knights_desc:0 "The Knights of the various holy orders across Christendom are among the most skilled cavalrymen in all of Christendom. Thus, it may be wise for us to trust their expertise and place them at the heads of our armies as well as their fellow knights."

estate_holy_orders_militaris_ordinis_desc:0 "While most members of the holy orders do not partake in any martial activities, there are numerous military orders throughout Christendom, valiant and skilled knights who fight for righteous causes against heathen enemies.

estate_holy_orders_grant_castles:0 "Grant Castles"
estate_holy_orders_grant_castles_desc:0 "With many of our domains far from the capital and difficult to defend, perhaps it would be wise to grant not only estates but also existing castles and fortifications to the military orders, which they would then maintain with their own abundant funds."

estate_holy_orders_heed_knightly_council_desc:0 "The knights of the holy orders, both of combat and non-combat roles, possess great experience and wisdom from their crusading exploits across the world and in the Holy Land itself. However, heeding their advice over that of the nobles may leave many of the latter disgruntled."
estate_holy_orders_heathen_estates:0 "Heathen Estates"
estate_holy_orders_heathen_estates_desc:0 "By granting landed estates to the holy orders in conquered lands with a non-Christian majority, we would leave the difficult administration and conversion of heathen subjects to the holy knights."
estate_holy_orders_colonial_domains:0 "Colonial Domains"
estate_holy_orders_colonial_domains_desc:0 "With our new holdings in the New World, perhaps we would benefit from granting domains in our colonies to the holy orders. This would allow them to both proselytize and culturally assimilate the natives - through whatever means they choose."

Thus, we can have the heir's attendants, the palace eunuchs, provide some private tutoring to the heir, though this will significantly increase the eunuch faction's influence in state affairs."
estate_holy_orders_invite_holy_orders_decision_title:0 "Invite the Holy Orders"
estate_holy_orders_invite_holy_orders_decision_desc:0 "Granting land to the Holy Orders and their knights may benefit us thanks to their financial expertise and well as their pious and valiant knights, who are among the most skilled cavalrymen in all of Christendom. At the same time, doing so will officially grant them an Estate and thus the influence that comes with such a gift."

estate_church_send_son_to_monastery_decision_title:0 "Send Non-Primary Son to Monastery"
estate_church_send_son_to_monastery_decision_desc:0 "To avoid conflicts regarding succession and division of the ream, we may send the youngest son of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to a monastery to serve as its abbot instead."
estate_church_send_son_to_monastery_decision.tt:0 "The §Oyoungest son§! who is NOT the ruler's primary heir is sent to a monastery and is removed from consideration for Salic inheritance, avoiding the §MSalic Split§!."

estate_nobles_marry_consort_from_servant_class_decision_desc:0 "Five queens in Merovingian history rose from slavery and become primary consorts and full fledged queens of Francia. Two of these queens, Fredegund and Balthild, proved to be exemplary queens and leaders in their own right, leaving their mark in history despite having started from the absolute bottom of the social hierarchy. Thus, rather than marrying individuals from the noble families of Francia, we have the option to search for diamonds in the rough and marrying truly capable and talented individuals regardless of their social class to our ruler."
estate_nobles_marry_consort_from_servant_class_decision.tt:0 "Marry a §YConsort§! with either §Mhigh ADM or DIP§! skill (either §G4§! or higher)"

estate_royal_abbots_francia:0 "Royal Abbots"
estate_royal_abbots_francia_desc:0 "We can reserve the right to appoint members of the royal family as well as other nobles loyal to our interests as abbots of monasteries across the realm.

estate_church_vow_of_ahimsa_desc:0 "Ahimsa refers to the principle of nonviolence which applies to actions towards all living things, the idea that one should not commit unneeded harm towards other beings. A concept shared by Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, ahimsa is one of the foundational principles of these faiths. Thus, we have the option to take a vow of ahimsa, swearing not to instigate unnecessary and bloody conflicts, instead focusing inward on bettering the lives of our people, just as the wise Ashoka the Great of Maurya had vowed many centuries ago. Like Ashoka, however, we will not be afraid to take up arms should a foreign polity or rebel faction threaten the lives and safety of our people."
estate_church_lesser_vehicles:0 "Sanghas of Lesser Vehicles"
estate_church_lesser_vehicles_desc:0 "While we disagree with some of the tenets held by other Buddhist schools, we still acknowledge that the value of their teachings, and we believe that followers of other schools will still embark on a path towards nirvana, albeit a more difficult path compared to the path taught by our own school. Because of this, these heretical schools are known as 'Lesser Vehicles,' inferior paths to nirvana, but paths to nirvana nonetheless. Since all Buddhist schools provide some way to attain nirvana, though some less effective than others, we have the choice to acknowledge the Sanghas, monastic orders, of these heretical schools so they may build temples alongside those of our own Sangha."

Thus, rather than marrying individuals from the noble families of Francia, we have the option to search for diamonds in the rough and marrying truly capable and talented individuals regardless of their social class to our ruler."
