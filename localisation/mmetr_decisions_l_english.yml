 #Decisions
 uma_swap_missions_decision_title: "Swap to Umayyad Missions"
 uma_swap_missions_decision_desc: "Having formed the Umayyads, would you like to §T Adopt the unique Umayyad Mission Tree§! in place of the existing mission tree?"
 
 petition_for_imperial_court_rank_decision_title: "Petition for Imperial Court Rank"
 petition_for_imperial_court_rank_decision_desc: "Although the Emperor himself does not possess much in the way of political or martial power, the renown carried by possessing a court rank granted to us by the Emperor himself continues to be a symbol of prestige. Thus, should we acquire enough renown as well as bargaining power with the court, we would be able to petition for the acquisition of a court rank that shall serve our best interests.\n\n§TThis Decision can be taken more than once to increase the current ruler's court rank, with the prestige requirement increasing with each promotion in rank. Ranks are lost upon ruler death. The lowest acquirable rank is Senior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade, while the maximum rank is Senior First Rank.§!"
 
 mmetr_dec_contest_the_imperial_mandate_title: "Contest the Imperial Mandate"
 mmetr_dec_contest_the_imperial_mandate_desc: "While there is another state that currently claims the Mandate of Heaven, the divine right to rule the Middle Kingdom, we have established a great and mighty state of our own in China, and our officials have reported many auspicious signs that we shall become the true emperors of the land. Thus, with enough political authority and prestige, we would be able to declare ourselves as Emperor and thus the true Son of Heaven, even while another ruler claims the Celestial Throne."
 mmetr_dec_restore_the_mandate_of_heaven_title: "Restore the Mandate of Heaven"
 mmetr_dec_restore_the_mandate_of_heaven_desc: "It was believed that the Mandate of Heaven was lost, and that no worthy successor was chosen by heaven. The imperial capital was overrun by avaricious fiends and barbarians, the common people fleeing from their homes, all harmony in the world stolen away by incapable rulers and ambitious generals. All had believed that no true Emperor of China would return again... until now. With enough martial might, political influence and the backing of the people, we may have the power to restore the Celestial Empire and claim the Mandate of Heaven once more after a long interregnum - an empire long divided must unite!"
 
 #Religious Decisions
 convert_to_judaism_mmetr_decision_title: "Convert to Judaism"
 convert_to_judaism_mmetr_decision_desc: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has recently been engrossed in profound theological discussions with Jewish scholars that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had invited to the [Root.GetAdjective] royal court. With further discussion and persuasion, perhaps the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] may even declare themselves as a new convert and follower of the one true God."
 convert_to_armenian_mmetr_decision_title: "Convert to the Armenian Religion"
 convert_to_armenian_mmetr_decision_desc: "While our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has chosen to sponsor the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion, whether as a result of true faith or political reasons, it cannot be denied that the traditional Armenian religion continues to persist and thrive among a large number of communities within our realm. As the Armenian polytheistic religion has been influenced by Iranian, Hellenic and Semitic gods over time, re-adopting the ancient Armenian faith as the state religion may be a smoother transition should our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] decide to do so, allowing for more easier integration of adjacent religions with the same or similar gods."
 convert_to_hinduism_from_buddhic_mmetr_decision_title: "Convert to Hinduism"
 convert_to_hinduism_from_buddhic_mmetr_decision_desc: "While there are several key differences between Buddhism and Hinduism, the two faiths have coexisted in India and Southeast Asia for centuries, in part due to similar ideas such as non-violence and karma. Additionally, some Hindu deities such as Indra are seen as protectors in some traditions of Buddhism, while some Hindus view the Buddha as the ninth avatar of Vishnu. Furthermore, some dynasties in the past have had alternating Hindu and Buddhist rulers, with many rulers sponsoring temples of both faiths at the same time. Thus, changing faiths from Buddhism to Hinduism, and vice versa, may not be as difficult as one may imagine."
 convert_to_waaqism_mmetr_decision_title: "Convert to Waaqism"
 convert_to_waaqism_mmetr_decision_desc: "Waaqism is the indigenous religion of the Somali and Oromo peoples, and followers of this faith worship the supreme sky god Waaq. A monotheistic religion, Waaq's followers believe him to be both their creator and their benefactor, providing blessings to the common people such as bountiful rainfall. If we should ever decide to convert to the Waaqi faith, with such a central divine figure in the faith, it would not be difficult for us to associate our own supreme deity with Waaq."
