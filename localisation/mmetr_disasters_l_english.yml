desc_yellow_turban_rebellion:0 "A Taoist sect known as the Way of the Supreme Peace has recently significantly grown in numbers. Its leaders are reknowned healers among all classes of Han society, and their growing influence across the social classes, most significantly the peasant class, is seen as a threat by many in the Han court. Wearing yellow turbans as a symbol of their faith and unity, their members continue to grow in number, and we fear they may one day rise in rebellion against the Han dynasty."

desc_abbasid_fitna:0 "Although the Abbasids reign as the official leaders of the Islamic world, the great size, power and influence of our realm is the source of jealously for many in our realm, several of which are scions of the Abbasid dynasty itself. Besides the various relatives of the Caliph, we also faced sectarian resistance from the Kharijites and Alids who live in our borders. Furthermore, the growing influence of the Turkic generals in the Caliphate is also a great source of concern for any ambitious Caliph who wishes to maintain their undisputed authority, with no strings attached, in the Caliphate. Thus, just as the Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates have faced, perhaps it may be inevitable that we may one day face a Fitna of our own."

Thus, should a notable pretender ever gain enough of a following to openly revolt against the Emperor, such a pretender would surely be only a symptom of the real disorder and unrest that is yet to come."

uprising_of_five_hu.10.desc:0 "A Xiongnu chief by the name of Liu Yuan has been persuaded by various northern Xiongnu officials and leaders to rebel against our government. Liu Yuan had already earned a reputation as a bright scholar and a talented military mind during his youth when Liu studied Chinese literature in our own capital of [Root.Capita.GetName]. Thus, this rebel leader must not be taken lightly.\n\nClaiming descendance from the Liu royal family of the Han dynasty to legitimize his rebellion, Liu Yuan has declared his own dynasty of Han Zhao and now leads a large Xiongnu barbarian army in an invasion of the northern provinces, marching alongside his grand marshal Liu Xuan, one of the Xiongnu officials who planned for the rebellion."

Even worse, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetDynasty] [Root.Monarch.GetName] in Luoyang has been captured by the barbarian forces, now a prisoner of war in the hands of the Xiongnu! Taken in chains with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head facing down in shame and despair, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was last seen imprisoned in the cells below [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own former city. We can only pray that the Xiongnu barbarians show mercy to our former Emperor...\n\nHaving claimed legitimacy as a descendant of the Han dynasty's ruling Liu clan, Liu Yuan has now earned even greater legitimacy as the successor of Han authority in the north. Various officials and generals across the Central Plains, having been disatisfied with our government for quite some time, have defected to the barbarian leader in a wave of treachery across the northern lands.\n\nSeveral imperial palaces have been burned down, and our own [Root.GetName] dynasty's mausoleums in Luoyang have been pillaged thoroughly by the rebels. This humiliation shall surely be known only as a grave disaster in the annals of history..."
