In the chaos, the Thai general Phraya Taksin escapes from Ayutthaya and names himself King of Siam; he establishes a new capital in Thonburi with the ambitions of reuniting the fractured Thai kingdom, which has fractured into five rival Thai states, one of which is the last remaining Prince of Ayutthaya.

 MONGOL_UNIFICATION_WAR_NAME: "Mongol War of Unification"
 MONGOL_UNIFICATION_WAR_DESC: "Temujin, who would later be known as Genghis Khan, is a controversial figure among the Mongol tribes who fear that his meritocratic system will usurp the authority of the Mongol nobles. Thus, various tribes including the Tayichiud, one of the three core tribes of the Khamag Mongol confederation, elect Jamukha as the Gur Khan, the 'universal ruler.' This move is as political as much as it is personal: Jamukha had known Genghis since childhood and was his anda, or blood brother. Representing the status quo of noble authority, Jamukha leads a coalition against his blood brother Temujin in a bid for becoming the Khan of a united Mongol state. Jamukha allies with the powerful Naimans, while Temujin allies with the Kereit ruler Ong Khan, who was the blood brother of Temujin's father Yesugei; thus, this bitter war of blood brothers shall spill blood upon the Mongol steppe one last time."

In 260 AD, the Roman emperor Valerian is defeated and captured by the Sassanid king of kings Shapur I - that very same year, the Roman governor Postumus gains de facto control of the lands of Gaul, and by 261 AD the cities of Britannia and Hispania recognized him as the true Roman emperor, rejecting the rule of Gallienus, son of the captive Valerian. Emperor Postumus declares himself Restitutor Galliarum, or 'Restorer of Gaul,' and establishes a Roman government much like the one in Rome, with consuls, a senate and a praetorian guard.

Before long, the kingdom of Palmyra expands into a vast empire, seizing the lands of Egypt, Syria and central Anatolia, and the great Queen Zenobia reigns over notable cities such as Alexandria, Antiochia and Ancyra. Though nominally swearing allegiance to the Roman Emperor, it would not be long before Zenobia declared her son Emperor, and thus herself Empress as his regent.
