 HIE_Events.1.T: "Imperial Crown of Iberia"
 HIE_Events.1.D: "The old Visigoths were the last people to unify the peninsula when they conquered the Galicians in  585. Ever since the Moorish invasion destroyed the Visigothic kingdom, the peninsula has been a place of struggle. Many have claimed the title of Spaniae and sought to reunify the old Roman borders of Hispania, but none have succeeded. Until now, that is. The Portuguese, corresponding to the Lusitaniae of old and maintaining their spirit of fierce independence, have triumphed where the haughty Castilians and the greedy Aragonese couldn't, establishing their own empire. \n\nNow, the question only remains what our imperial title should be. Traditionalists in the court argue that keeping the long-sought for title of Hispania is best for unifying thr lands and keeping the support of our people, while revisionists argue that we should keep the title of Lusitanians, forging it into a new empire by right of conquest. The decision is up to you, my King."

 HIE_Events.2.D: "Having united the whole of Italy under the banner of Catholicism, the Pope has seen fit to declare it 'The Kingdom of God'.

 HIE_Events.3.T: "Accepting Christianity?"
 HIE_Events.3.D: "In the shadow of the towering pyramids, amidst the ancient groves where the spirits of our ancestors still whisper, a great dilemma weighs heavy upon the hearts of our people. For centuries, we have walked in harmony with the old gods of our land, offering prayers and sacrifices to appease their divine will. But now, a new force has emerged from the distant shores of Europe, bearing the emblem of the cross and the teachings of the one they call Jesus Christ. \nAs the missionaries from across the great ocean speak of salvation and redemption, of a single god who reigns supreme over all creation, we are torn between the faith of our forefathers and the allure of this new divine revelation. The stories of miracles and divine intervention captivate our minds, stirring within us a longing for a higher power beyond the pantheon of our ancient gods. Yet, to abandon the traditions that have sustained us for generations is to betray the very essence of our identity as a people. \nIn this time of uncertainty, we stand at a crossroads, torn between the whispers of our ancestors and the promises of a new faith. Will we remain steadfast in our devotion to the old gods, or will we embrace the monotheistic creed brought by the missionaries from afar? The decision weighs heavy upon our souls, for it will shape the destiny of our people for generations to come."
