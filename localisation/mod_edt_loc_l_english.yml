Beginning in 1602, the conflict primarily involved the Dutch companies invading Portuguese colonies in the Americas, Africa, India and the Far East. The war can be thought of as an extension of the Eighty Years' War being fought in Europe at the time between Spain and the Netherlands, as Portugal was in a dynastic union with the Spanish Crown after the War of the Portuguese Succession, for most of the conflict. However, the conflict had little to do with the war in Europe and served mainly as a way for the Dutch to gain an overseas empire and control trade at the cost of the Portuguese. English forces also assisted the Dutch at certain points in the war (though in later decades, English and Dutch would become fierce rivals). Because of the cargo of conflict, this war would be nicknamed the Spice War"

However, mobilization of the Christian powers and their peoples was unorganized, leading to incidents of violence throughout the land caused by peasant groups that departed before the planned date of the crusade. These incidents caused Alexios to be skeptical of the princes and their armies when they arrived in Constantinople, and he had no interest in joining them in battle. Thus, unsupported by the Byzantines and with only God behind them, the Crusaders cross the seas to the faraway land of Jerusalem."

As the war raged on, a Quadruple Alliance was secured by the Treaty of Warsaw in 1745, marking the entrance of Great Britain, the Dutch Republic and Saxony on the side of the Habsburgs. Meanwhile, France becomes preoccupied with its struggle with Britain and the Netherlands, leaving Prussia isolated in the east.

Now that we have restored order in the Balkans and rebuilt our old imperial government, it is time to take back what is rightfully ours. Our government will aim to drive the Turks from Asia and protect the Romans who still live there."

As our Roman Empire stands upon the brink of being overwhelmed by the infidel Turk, the Pope of Rome has finally agreed to the long-standing Orthodox request for a Great Ecumenical Council to address the question of the Schism between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. However, while the pope has finally conceded an open discussion and debate on questions of reunion, it is not clear that the Roman See's terms will have changed substantially since the last attempt at Church Union in 1274. Yet, in practical terms, we would be grateful of western aid against the Mahometans, while the Roman pope would no doubt be pleased to be able to use the 'return' of the Orthodox to the Catholic fold as a way of facing down demands for reform from his own churchmen who oppose his monopoly of power.

He was looking around the church and asking a lot of questions about the saint, and had an entourage of other Latins with him. The villagers clearly saw that he planned to steal the saint's relics, just as the Venetians stole the relics of St Nicholas from Myra in Lycia. They banded together just in time and drove the Latins away forcibly. The Latins have protested the priest's treatment, and demand a response from us."

Both sides, moreover, have claimed victory, but now they look to you for the final decision. If we decide to pronounce in favour of our Orthodox theologians, then our own people will of course be overjoyed, but our Latin subjects will be extremely vexed.

 byz_main.d.1: "Giovanni Giustiniani Longo was a young Genoese captain, a member of one of the greatest families of the Republic, a kinsman to the powerful house of Doria in Genoa and protostrator of the Eastern Roman Empire. He led 700 professional soldiers, both Genovese and Greeks from the island of Chios, which at the time was part of the Republic of Genoa, to the defense of Constantinople against the Ottoman army of Sultan Mehmed II in 1453. He personally financed, organized and led this expedition on his own initiative, and upon arriving was placed in command of the land defenses by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos of the Byzantine Empire. Longo was key in controlling the land forces and keeping the Greeks, Genoese and Venetians from arguing with each other, and instead kept focused on repairing the land walls after the Ottoman cannon had shot holes in them. It was at least partly because of Longo's charisma that the Byzantine forces were able to hold out so long against overwhelming odds."
 byz_main.a.1: "I love that guy!"
 byz_main.t.2: "Welcome Roman!"
 byz_main.d.2: "The Byzantine Empire is the predominantly Greek-speaking continuation of the Roman Empire during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Its capital city is Constantinople originally known as Byzantium. Its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire. The borders of the Empire evolved a great deal over its existence, as it went through several cycles of decline and recovery. During the reign of Justinian I (r. 527–565), the Empire reached its greatest extent after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast, including north Africa, Italy, and Rome itself, which it held for two more centuries. During the reign of Maurice (r. 582–602), the Empire's eastern frontier was expanded and the north stabilised. However, his assassination caused a two-decade-long war with Sassanid Persia which exhausted the Empire's resources and contributed to major territorial losses during the Muslim conquests of the 7th century. During the Macedonian dynasty (10th-11th centuries), the Empire again expanded and experienced a two-century long renaissance, which came to an end with the loss of much of Asia Minor to the Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert (1071). The final centuries of the Empire exhibited a general trend of decline. It struggled to recover during the 12th century, but was delivered a mortal blow during the Fourth Crusade, when Constantinople was sacked and the Empire dissolved and divided into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms. Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople and re-establishment of the Empire in 1261, Byzantium remained only one of several small rival states in the area for the final two centuries of its existence. This volatile period is on a way and only YOU can save our people from the threat of the Turkish hordes. We survived for 1000 years after the fall of our Western brother and now its up to your leadership to decide - to survive or to be lost in centuries of history! Welcome, our new Basileus!

He was the son of the emperor Leo VI and his fourth wife, Zoe Karbonopsina, and the nephew of his predecessor, the emperor Alexander. Constantine VII was renowned for his abilities as a writer and scholar. He wrote, or had commissioned, the works De Ceremoniis, describing the kinds of court ceremonies, De Administrando Imperio, giving advice on running the Empire internally and on fighting external enemies, and a history of the Empire covering events following the death of the chronographer Theophanes the Confessor in 817. Amongst his historical works was a history eulogising the reign and achievements of his grandfather, Basil I (Vita Basilii).

The family is first attested in the 11th century, with Nikephoros Palaiologos, general under Michael VII Doukas. His son George Palaiologos was a friend of Alexios I Komnenos and brother-in-law to Alexios' wife Irene Doukaina. He commanded the garrison of Dyrrhachium during the Battle of Dyrrhachium against Robert Guiscard, the Norman Duke of Apulia and Calabria in 1081. After the Fourth Crusade, members of the family fled to the neighboring Empire of Nicaea, where Michael VIII Palaiologos became co-emperor in 1259, recaptured Constantinople and was crowned sole emperor of the Byzantine Empire in 1261. His descendants are ruling the empire till nowadays. We can ask our historians to trace our descent from Constantine I. This will greatly increase our prestige. What should we do?"

 byz_main.t.15: "Komnenos Dynasty"
 byz_main.d.15: "Glorious Komnenos dynasty is now ruling our Empire! The Komnenos dynasty of Byzantine emperors was founded by Isaac I Komnenos, a Stratopedarch of the East under Michael VI. In 1057 Isaac led a coup against Michael and was proclaimed emperor. Although his reign lasted only till 1059, when he was pressured by his courtiers to abdicate and become a monk, Isaac initiated many useful reforms. The dynasty returned to the throne with the accession of Alexios I Komnenos, Isaac I's nephew, in 1081. By this time, descendants of all the previous dynasties of Byzantium seem to have disappeared from the realm, such as the important Scleros and Argyros families. Descendants of those emperors lived abroad, having married into the royal families of Georgia, Russia, France, Persia, Italy, Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia - thus it was easier for the Komnenos family to ascend to the throne. The Komnenoi were related to the Doukas family, whereby the clan often was referred as Komnenodoukai or Comnenoducae and both surnames were used together by several individuals. Alexios I married Irene Doukaina, the grandniece of Constantine X Doukas, a general who had succeeded Isaac I in 1059. Several families descended from the Komnenodoukai, such as Palaiologos, Angelos, Vatatzes and Laskaris. Alexios and Irene's youngest daughter Theodora ensured the future success of the Angelos family by marrying into it - Theodora's grandsons were the emperors Isaac II Angelos and Alexios III Angelos."

 byz_main.d.16: "Glorious Doukas dynasty is now ruling our Empire! The most famous members of this group were the dynasty's founder, Emperor Constantine X Doukas (r. 1059–1067), his brother John Doukas, katepano and later Caesar, Constantine's son Michael VII Doukas (r. 1071–1078), Michael's younger brothers, Konstantios and Andronikos Doukas, Michael's son and co-emperor Constantine Doukas and John's son, the general Andronikos Doukas. During this period, the family intermarried with other aristocratic clans, before becoming emperor, Constantine X had married into the powerful Dalassenoi family, and took as a second wife Eudokia Makrembolitissa, niece of the Patriarch Michael Keroularios. Further dynastic matches were made with the clans of the Anatolian military aristocracy, including the Palaiologoi and the Pegonitai. The most important connection, however, was to the Komnenoi - in 1077, Alexios Komnenos, then a general and later emperor (r. 1081–1118), married Irene Doukaina, the great-niece of Constantine X; thereafter, the family name Komnenodoukas was often used. This marriage alliance crucial for Alexios's own rise to the purple - his marriage to a Doukaina made him senior to his elder brother Isaac, and it was Doukai financial and political support that largely facilitated the successful and bloodless coup that brought him to the throne."

The House of Kantakouzenos was one of the most prominent noble families of the Byzantine Empire in the last centuries of its existence. The family was one of the Empire's wealthiest and provided several prominent governors and generals, as well as two Byzantine emperors. The Kantakouzenoi intermarried extensively with other Byzantine and Bulgarian noble families such as the Palaiologoi, the Philanthropenoi, the Asen, and the Tarchaneiotes. Michael Kantakouzenos was appointed governor of the Morea in 1308 and his son, John VI Kantakouzenos, rose to be megas domestikos, regent, and eventually emperor (1341–1354) before resigning and retiring to a monastery after a failed civil war. John VI's eldest son Matthew also reigned as his co-emperor and as a pretender (1353–1357) before being captured and forced to resign as well. John's younger son Manuel Kantakouzenos remained despotes of the Morea from 1349 until 1380. Of John VI's daughters, Helena Kantakouzene married John and Matthew's rival John V Palaiologos (r. 1341–1391), Maria married Nikephoros II Orsini of Epirus, and Theodora married the Ottoman bey Orhan I."

 byz_main.d.18: "Glorious Angelos dynasty is now ruling our Empire! The Angelos family was a noble Byzantine lineage which gave rise to three Byzantine emperors from 1185 to 1204. From the 13th to the 15th century, a branch of the family ruled Epiros, Thessaly and Thessaloniki under the name of Angelos Komnenos Doukas. The lineage was founded by Constantine Angelos from Philadelphia, commander of the imperial fleet in Sicily, who married Theodora Komnene (born 1096), a daughter of emperor Alexios I Komnenos. According to a 12th-century historian, Constantine was handsome but of lowly origin. In 1185, Andronikos Angelos' son Isaac II Angelos deposed Andronikos I Komnenos and was proclaimed Byzantine Emperor. He was succeeded by his brother Alexios III Angelos and his son Alexios IV Angelos. Under the weak reign of the Angelos dynasty, the Byzantine empire deteriorated and soon fell prey to Latin crusaders and Venetians in the Fourth Crusade. After the fall of Constantinople and the establishment of the Latin Empire in 1204, members of the Angeloi assumed power in Epiros and Thessaly, naming themselves Angeloi Komnenoi Doukai."

It survived the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC, the fall of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC, the split of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, and barbarian rule of Rome in the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries. The Senate of the West Roman Empire continued to function until 603 AD. After the Western Roman Empire fell in 476, the Senate in the west functioned for a time under barbarian rule before being restored after reconquest of much of the Western Roman Empire's territories during the reign of Justinian I, until it ultimately disappeared. However, the Eastern Senate survived in Constantinople, before the ancient institution finally vanished by our Emperor."

 byz_main.t.27: "Phokas Dynasty"
 byz_main.d.27: "Glorious Phokas dynasty is now ruling our Empire! Phokas or Phocas is the name of a Byzantine aristocratic clan from Cappadocia, which in the 9th and 10th centuries provided a series of high-ranking generals and an emperor, Nikephoros II Phokas (r. 963–969). Its members and their clients monopolized the high command positions of the Byzantine army for much of the 10th century and led the successful Byzantine offensive against the Arabs in the East. As one of the leading families of the Anatolian military aristocracy, the Phokades were also involved in a series of rebellions that laid claim to power and challenged the emperors at Constantinople. Their power was eventually broken by Basil II (r. 976–1025), and the family declined in importance after the 11th century."

The Laskaris or Lascaris family is a Byzantine Greek noble family whose members formed the ruling dynasty of the Empire of Nicaea from 1204 to 1261 and remained among the senior nobility up to the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire, whereupon many emigrated to Italy and then to Smyrna. Under the new Palaiologan dynasty, the Laskarids retained a certain prominence - several members of the family were local governors and courtiers. Among the most notable members are Manuel Laskaris, Domestic of the Schools ca. 1320, and Alexios, a megas hetaireiarches ca. 1370."

They would make mincemeat of any hooligans before the riot has a chance of spreading to other districts, but there could be significant collateral damage..."

 byz_main.b.29: "The City Guard can handle it."
 byz_main.t.30: "Drunken Varangians"
 byz_main.d.30: "Local official sends word that several members of the Varangian Guard ran amok in his quarter of Constantinople yesterday. In their drunken stupor, the Norsemen set fire to an inn, killed three guards and physically abused five local merchants and two priests. The people are crying out for justice."
 byz_main.a.30: "Make an example of them."
 byz_main.b.30: "Oh, come now. Boys will be boys."
 byz_main.t.31: "Meanwhile at the Imperial Palace..."
 byz_main.d.31: "$MONARCH$ is enjoying a late supper at the Great Palace in Constantinople, sampling some new wines brought in from the provinces, when the sound of a distant explosion is heard. Windows shatter and the chandelier above begins to sway as the shockwave hits a second later. Dust trickles down from the roof, and to $MONARCHTITLE$ dismay some of it lands in his wine. $MONARCH$ hurry to a balcony overlooking the city and see an intense fire burning at one of the warehouses by the docks. The nearby water in the Golden Horn is also ablaze, and the fire has already spread to several ships in the busy inlet. While their crews are in the process of abandoning them, the harbor area is rocked by a flurry of smaller explosions from the burning warehouse."
 byz_main.a.31: "This must be investigated!"
 byz_main.b.31: "Pretty, but $MONARCH$ needs a new glass of wine."
 byz_main.t.32: "SPQR"
 byz_main.d.32: "The Roman Republic was the period of the ancient Roman civilization when the government operated as a republic. It began with the overthrow of the Roman monarchy, traditionally dated around 509 BC, and its replacement by a government headed by two consuls, elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate. A complex constitution gradually developed, centered on the principles of a separation of powers and checks and balances. Except in times of dire national emergency, public offices were limited to one year, so that, in theory at least, no single individual wielded absolute power over his fellow citizens. During the first two centuries of its existence the Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance, from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula. By the following century it included North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Greece, and what is now southern France. Two centuries after that, towards the end of the 1st century BC, it included the rest of modern France, and much of the eastern Mediterranean. By this time, despite the Republic's traditional and lawful constraints against any individual's acquisition of permanent political powers, Roman politics was dominated by a small number of Roman leaders, their uneasy alliances punctuated by a series of civil wars. The victor in one of these civil wars, Octavian, reformed the Republic as a Principate, with himself as Romes first citizen. The Senate continued to sit and debate. Annual magistrates were elected as before, but final decisions on matters of policy, warfare, diplomacy and appointments were privileged to Augustus through his wielding of a number of separate powers simultaneously. One of his many titles was imperator from which the title emperor is derived, and he is customarily called the first Roman Emperor."
 byz_main.a.32: "Republic is restored!"
 byz_main.t.33: "$MONARCH$ dismantles Senate demes"
 byz_main.d.33: "Time has come. Roman Senate was one of the most enduring institutions in Roman history, being founded in the first days of the city (traditionally founded in 753 BC). It survived the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC, the fall of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC, the split of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, and barbarian rule of Rome in the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries. The Senate of the West Roman Empire continued to function until 603 AD. After the Western Roman Empire fell in 476, the Senate in the west functioned for a time under barbarian rule before being restored after reconquest of much of the Western Roman Empire's territories during the reign of Justinian I, until it ultimately disappeared. However, the Eastern Senate survived in Constantinople, before the ancient institution finally vanished by our Emperor."
 byz_main.a.33: "Bye bye senators."
 byz_main.t.34: "$MONARCH$ chooses a new Palace Official"
 byz_main.d.34: "Our glorious Emperor $MONARCH$ has decided to appoint a lifetime Palace Official, the person who will be in charge of the Imperial Diplomacy at the court and advice to the Emperor. The Byzantine Empire had a complex system of aristocracy and bureaucracy, which was inherited from the Roman Empire. Over the more than 1000 years of the Empire's existence, different titles were adopted and discarded, and many lost or gained prestige. At first the various titles of the Empire were the same as those in the late Roman Empire. By the time of Heraclius in the 7th century many of the titles had become obsolete, by the time of Alexius I, many of the positions were either new or drastically changed, but they remained basically the same from Alexius' reign to the fall of the Empire in 1453.

 byz_main.d.38: "A gladiator was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals. Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their legal and social standing and their lives by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death. Irrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in high and low art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world."

 byz_faction.t.16: "Religious Wisdom"
 byz_faction.d.16: "One of the Imperial Senators affiliated with the Administrative deme has developed a reputation as quite the scholar. The man is specialized in the writings of St. Peter, and it is said that he is capable of reciting broad parts of the St. Peter's corpus by heart. A scholar of such erudition brings influence and power to his deme."
 byz_faction.a.16: "Converse with the scholar"
 byz_faction.b.16: "Put the man to work"
 byz_faction.t.17: "Literati Publishes"
 byz_faction.d.17: "A scholar affiliated with the Administrative deme has published a novel that has been hailed by commentators as one of the greatest achievements of contemporary literature. The publication of such an important work increases the standing of both the writer and his deme."
 byz_faction.a.17: "He is a credit to his nation"
 byz_faction.b.17: "I didn't think it was that good"
 byz_faction.t.18: "Retainer Flogged"
 byz_faction.d.18: "One of the big names within the Administrative deme has earned himself a reputation for cruelty since taking to regularly flogging a particular retainer of his, of whom he seems to have a particular distaste. While the Administrative Senator is fully within his rights to punish his lessers, people generally feel that his treatment could benefit from a little moderation."
 byz_faction.a.18: "He's setting an excellent example!"
 byz_faction.b.18: "Tell him to control himself"
 byz_faction.t.19: "Drama on The Mesta River"
 byz_faction.d.19: "A Mesta River tax barge, containing a significant share of this year's taxes from the eastern provinces, has been boarded and seized by pirates. The official responsible for maintaining security on the relevant section of the river, a young senator from the Administrative deme, has suffered a nervous breakdown after hearing about the incident and is reportedly locked up in his bedchamber, refusing to come out."
 byz_faction.a.19: "I guess we can kiss those taxes goodbye"
 byz_faction.b.19: "Levy extra taxes to remedy the situation"
 byz_faction.t.20: "Gold Mine Discovered"
 byz_faction.d.20: "A gold mine has been discovered in one of our provinces, and the man in charge of the prospecting that went into finding it is reportedly a young senator affiliated with the Administrative deme. Exploiting this new and rich lode may seem like a foregone conclusion, but some warn against the venture, citing concerns over a potential overextension of the money supply."
 byz_faction.a.20: "Dig deep and greedily!"
 byz_faction.b.20: "Let sleeping dogs lie"
 byz_faction.t.21: "Bullion Leaves the Country"
 byz_faction.d.21: "Large amounts of silver bullion have left the country on various trade barges sailing from our many ports. Officials in the Administrative deme are being blamed for the development, as their statist trade policy is believed to be causing the exodus of wealth."
 byz_faction.a.21: "Expensive!"
 byz_faction.b.21: "Mint more to make up for the losses"
 byz_faction.t.22: "Renovating old Imperial Gardens"
 byz_faction.d.22: "An old Komnenos Dynasty gardens in one of our provinces has fallen into disrepair after several years of neglected maintenance, and now a local official has requested funds to restore them. The official in question is related to the Administrative deme, so any money spent on the gardens will also be money spent on the Administrative senators."
 byz_faction.a.22: "Naturally we shall restore it"
 byz_faction.b.22: "We have no time for such nonsense"
 byz_faction.t.23: "The Birinus's Smile"
 byz_faction.d.23: "The writings of Saint Birinus are being forgotten in $PROVINCENAME$, as the inhabitants there have more and more taken to practicing Herecy rite. The news comes as a major setback for the Diplomatic deme, which has prided itself on the successes of state-sanctioned Orthodoxy. We could dispatch officials to immediately restore order to the province, but forcing the locals into a different faith will most likely hurt the economic viability of the province."
 byz_faction.a.23: "They may believe what they wish"
 byz_faction.b.23: "Dispatch officials immediately"
 byz_faction.t.24: "Crack-down on Heresy"
 byz_faction.d.24: "The Diplomatic deme has taken matters into its own hands in $PROVINCENAME$ recently, where religious heresies have previously been known to ferment. The Diplomatic deme has been quite active in the area, spreading the word of God. If we allow the Diplomatic deme to continue working in the province, it is likely that the local religious affiliation will change."
 byz_faction.a.24: "Excellent!"
 byz_faction.b.24: "Leave those poor locals be"
 byz_faction.t.25: "Diplomacy of the Senate"
 byz_faction.d.25: "Officials from the Diplomatic deme of Senate have been very active in the foreign diplomacy of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Court lately. One foreign power in particular occupies the deme's attention, and the deme feels that this foreign power should submit to the authority of The Roman Kingdom. The foreign ambassador has been summoned to the imperial palace, what shall we tell him?"
 byz_faction.a.25: "That he may go in peace"
 byz_faction.b.25: "That he best prepare his defenses"
 byz_faction.t.26: "Bound Feet"
 byz_faction.d.26: "Keeping the feet of young girls bound and tied until every bone in them has grown broken and deformed creates wonders of female and human beauty. The fashion of bound feet waxes and wanes every hundred years or so, and this time the wax seems to be due to the fact that the Diplomatic deme is actively promoting this sound ideal of beauty all over the country."
 byz_faction.a.26: "Everyone must follow this example!"
 byz_faction.b.26: "This sounds a bit over the top"
 byz_faction.t.27: "Imperial Insults"
 byz_faction.d.27: "A young senator of the Diplomatic deme, employed in the reception of foreign dignitaries and potentates to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ court, has caused a diplomatic blunder today, when he, contrary to protocol, bowed two times rather than three when greeting a foreign diplomat. This major loss of face for the courtier has quickly developed into a loss of face for the entire Diplomatic deme!"
 byz_faction.a.27: "Apologize to the foreigner"
 byz_faction.b.27: "Behead the courtier"
 byz_faction.t.28: "Inspecting The Banners"
 byz_faction.d.28: "The armies have amassed on the exercise field for the Grand Army Inspection of $YEAR$. Everywhere you look there is a forest of spears and swords, aiming in defiance at the heavens above. Several powerful generals and marshals are present, many of who are from the Diplomatic deme, which, for the past few years, has done everything in its power to strengthen its position within the army."
 byz_faction.a.28: "Commend the generals for their work"
 byz_faction.b.28: "You call this an army!?"
 byz_faction.t.29: "Diplomatic deme Conspiracy"
 byz_faction.d.29: "A conspiracy has formed within the ranks of the socially conservative Diplomatic deme, which has begun maneuvering to make the Diplomatic deme dominant within palace politics. By promoting their own candidates at Imperial Examinations those senators has begun an ascension to power which is quite remarkable. How should we deal with the Diplomatic's deme conspiracies?"
 byz_faction.a.29: "Nothing. It is merely politics"
 byz_faction.b.29: "Behead a few big-wigs"
 byz_faction.t.30: "Examining the Examinations"
 byz_faction.d.30: "An official from the Military deme has published a document detailing his criticisms of alleged biases and flaws in the present processes of Imperial Examinations. The official has included a short list of suggestions of simple changes that, in his opinion, would vastly improve the quality of the process. The suggestions fly in the collective face of the Diplomatic deme, which has vigorously defended the Examinations against any and all new-fangled ideas."
 byz_faction.a.30: "Change we can believe in!"
 byz_faction.b.30: "The Diplomatic deme has the right idea!"
 byz_faction.t.31: "A Gift From the Diplomatic deme senator"
 byz_faction.d.31: "A high magistrate affiliated with the Diplomatic deme has presented your Majesty with a most exquisite gift"
 byz_faction.a.31: "Study the book closely"
 byz_faction.b.31: "Silly books. Change!"
 byz_faction.t.32: "Records of the Grand Historian"
 byz_faction.d.32: "$MONARCHTITLE$, You have reigned for some time now, and many consider it time to compile another grand edition of the 'Records of the Grand Historian'. The Grand Historian himself is affiliated with the Diplomatic deme. Compiling a tome detailing the fortunes of Basileia Rhomanion during your reign would cost a fair bit of money, and give prestige to the Diplomatic deme, but the benefits might outweigh the costs. Shall we put the historian to work?"
 byz_faction.a.32: "Yes!"
 byz_faction.b.32: "No!"
 byz_faction.t.33: "An Athos Monk"
 byz_faction.d.33: "A traveler from Mount Athos has arrived in $CAPITAL$. He says that he has traveled from far-away Mount Athos, and that he comes to spread the word of the God. The Diplomatic deme opposes this request, preferring instead the traditional teachings of Orthodoxy as the sole font of spiritual guidance for our people. While there is a case to be made for the Diplomatic deme's position, overly heavy-handed treatment of other Religies will destabilize our country."
 byz_faction.a.33: "Of course he is free to preach"
 byz_faction.b.33: "We should weed out this pest!"
 byz_faction.t.34: "Burning of Books"
 byz_faction.d.34: "The Diplomatic deme has had enough of the discord and strife that plagues $COUNTRY$. Pointing to the myriad of schools of thought that flourish within the realm it is no wonder, they argue, that we live in troubled times. The Diplomatic deme holds that only a return to true Orthodox values can restore order, and what better way than to burn a few books of heterodox teachings?"
 byz_faction.a.34: "That does sound like an idea!"
 byz_faction.b.34: "Some other time, perhaps"
 byz_faction.t.35: "Burying of Scholars"
 byz_faction.d.35: "The Diplomatic deme, tired of the pluralistic thought climate that has taken hold in Basileia Rhomaion in the past few years, has taken matter into its own hands. In several provinces all over the country several prominent scholars of other schools than the official Orthodox doctrine have been buried alive. That this will be a blow to innovation is already clear, but how shall we punish the Diplomatic deme senators?"
 byz_faction.a.35: "Forgive and forget!"
 byz_faction.b.35: "Repay them in kind"
 byz_faction.t.36: "Konstantinos Statuette"
 byz_faction.d.36: "A rare statuette from the Konstantinos the Great era has been discovered during renovations of an old Temple. The idea has crossed your mind that it might be clever to bestow the statuette upon a worthy subject to strengthen his loyalty to you, The Emperor. Deme loyalties will doubtlessly change on account of such an impressive gift delivered directly from the Emperor's own hand. Who shall we give it to?"
 byz_faction.a.36: "The Grand Historian"
 byz_faction.b.36: "The Eldest Official"
 byz_faction.c.36: "The Grand Marshal"
 byz_faction.t.37: "The Classic of Music"
 byz_faction.d.37: "Apart from the five classic texts compiled by Christian Saints, tradition also speaks of a sixth Classic"
 byz_faction.a.37: "The Province Governor"
 byz_faction.b.37: "A Local Literati"
 byz_faction.t.38: "Cheating at Examinations"
 byz_faction.d.38: "Several examinees have been caught cheating at the Imperial Examinations this year. Instead of the prescribed three day solitude, the examinees have had ready access to the outside world. The cheating was discovered when several disallowed manuscripts were found in the examinees' rooms. The cheating appears systematic and supported by corrupt examinators. Three primary suspects have been identified. Who do we blame?"
 byz_faction.a.38: "The Head Examinator"
 byz_faction.b.38: "A Court Eunuch"
 byz_faction.c.38: "A Scholar at the Examination Center"

 byz_faction.b.39: "The Military Solution"
 byz_faction.c.39: "The Diplomatic Solution"
 byz_faction.t.40: "Honoring the Ancestors"
 byz_faction.d.40: "The teachings of Christian Saint stress the importance of understanding and respecting old books that weave the web of society, and one of the most important relationships is that between father and son. Those who have gone before us deserve our thanksgiving, and it has been long enough since last we made an offering. Various courtiers have suggested sacrifices that your Majesty could perform. What seems most appropriate to present as an offering to honor the ancestors?"
 byz_faction.a.40: "Red meat, to keep them fed"
 byz_faction.b.40: "Candles, to light their way"
 byz_faction.c.40: "Spirit money, to pay their dues"
 byz_faction.t.41: "Bad results"
 byz_faction.d.41: "We have started to build a new Temple, but something gone wrong. Who is responsible for this?"
 byz_faction.a.41: "The diviner himself, he's clearly gone mad"
 byz_faction.b.41: "The builder, he did not consult the diviners"
 byz_faction.c.41: "Whoever put me up to building it"
 byz_faction.t.42: "Court Bickering"
 byz_faction.d.42: "One of your Marshals has been insulted by a high ranking senator from the Administrative deme. Apparently the men have had a hard time getting along for quite some time, and the insult was probably not entirely unprovoked. Nevertheless the matter has become a pivot point of demeal politics at the court, and it might be wise if The Emperor himself gave some input on the issue."
 byz_faction.a.42: "The Marshal needs to stop complaining"
 byz_faction.b.42: "The Senator needs to apologize"
 byz_faction.c.42: "The Emperor needs a vacation"
 byz_faction.t.43: "The Necropolis of $MONARCH$"
 byz_faction.d.43: "$MONARCHTITLE$, there comes a time in the life of every Roman Emperor when he must begin to consider his final resting place. In order to ensure a suitable position for yourself in the hereafter, it is of the utmost importance that you pick a worthy and fitting tomb in this life. The various courtiers have their own ideas on what the centerpiece of a new tomb complex should be."

 byz_faction.t.44: "The Gilded Garden"
 byz_faction.d.44: "Wrapped in the reddish gold of a dying sun, and reflecting the blue of the heavens suspended above it, the old Gilded Garden has stood since the times of the Komnenos dynasty, or perhaps even longer still. The silence and darkness within the Garden is a stark contrast to the light and reflection outside of. Since Oriental Orthodoxy has become rare, the Garden has gone unused, and your courtiers have various suggestions as to what could be done with it."
 byz_faction.a.44: "Military demes"
 byz_faction.b.44: "Administrative demes"
 byz_faction.c.44: "Diplomatic demes"
 byz_faction.t.45: "The Shadow that Stalks the Corridor"
 byz_faction.d.45: "As you walk through the long corridors of the Sacred Palace, you suddenly have a distinct sense of being followed. In the corner of your eye a white-clad man approaches you from behind. You cannot see the dagger, gleaming with malice, but you know it is there, behind you, a mere few yards from your heart. Before you the corridor splits. To your right is the Senate Military deme quarter, guards and safety, and to your left lies the Administrative deme quarters. What do you do?"
 byz_faction.a.45: "Flee to the Military deme Senator!"
 byz_faction.b.45: "Flee to the Administrative deme Senator!"
 byz_faction.c.45: "Stand and fight!"
 byz_faction.t.46: "Administrative Senator Swindles the Treasury"
 byz_faction.d.46: "A high ranking member of the Administrative deme has been caught siphoning funds out of the Imperial Treasury and into his own pocket. The only punishment that can at all be considered is of course death, but the question of who should replace him is less obvious. There are powerful candidates within both the Military and Diplomatic demes, but the candidates from the Administrative deme are doubtlessly the ones best equipped to handle the job. Who should get the job?"
 byz_faction.a.46: "A Military Senator Candidate"
 byz_faction.b.46: "A Diplomatic Senator Candidate"
 byz_faction.c.46: "Sigh. Find a new Administrative Senator"
 byz_faction.t.47: "Brigands on the old trade road"
 byz_faction.d.47: "Things have quickly gone from bad to worse in several provinces across the country, where brigands and highwaymen are becoming ever more of a problem. The problem has been particularly noticeable along what remains of the old 'From Varagians to Greeks'. The matter was discussed recently at a Senate session of the Imperial Court, and several solutions to the brigand problem were presented. How shall we combat the brigands?"
 byz_faction.a.47: "With a large scale military campaign"
 byz_faction.b.47: "By setting up local militias"
 byz_faction.c.47: "Through prayers and faith"
 byz_faction.t.48: "Reputation for Cruelty"
 byz_faction.d.48: "Since reecent events people have begun avoiding you. It did not happen overnight, but progressively, as the months have passed, you have noticed that fewer and fewer people seem to take the time to pay their Emperor the proper respects and courtesies. After some cautious inquiries among trusted retainers you discover the reason"
 byz_faction.a.48: "Embrace the reputation"
 byz_faction.b.48: "Initiate a propaganda campaign"
 byz_faction.t.49: "Portentous Solar Eclipse"
 byz_faction.d.49: "You can only stare in awe as the glowing white of the sun disappears behind the black disc suspended in the sky, and the world turns to darkness despite it being mid day. A few minutes later the disc has passed by the sun, and light returns. You are shaken by the experience, but many of your subjects are absolutely terrified. Some whisper that the eclipse proves that throne has passed from our dynasty. What should we make of this situation?"
 byz_faction.a.49: "Execute the court astrologer"
 byz_faction.b.49: "Bribe the people"
 byz_faction.c.49: "Prohibit all discussion of the topic"
 byz_faction.t.50: "Awakening of The Great Prophet"
 byz_faction.d.50: "Mysterious rumors are coming from one of our provinces, telling of an old statue of the Prophet that supposedly has come alive and then simply walked off! Whatever the truth, many have begun believing that such omens are signs that our Empire is in danger. The event has caused the teachings of the Oriental Orthodoxy to gain traction in the area. How shall we respond to these rumors?"
 byz_faction.a.50: "Not at all"
 byz_faction.b.50: "With violence, how else?"
 byz_faction.t.51: "Temple Desecrated"
 byz_faction.d.51: "As the officials enter the Temple in the morning they come upon a chaotic scene. Altars have been overturned, figurines smashed and walls and tapestries defaced. Someone has entered the Temple during the dark hours of the night, and committed the most heinous acts of sacrilege. No one knows who is responsible for these crimes. What shall we do about the Temple?"
 byz_faction.a.51: "Restore it"
 byz_faction.b.51: "Tear it down"
 byz_faction.t.52: "Plague Strikes The Court"
 byz_faction.d.52: "Plagues, famines, droughts and calamities are becoming increasingly frequent in $COUNTRY$ these days, and now a particularly nasty disease has arrived at court. Yesterday morning an Administrative Senator employed at the Public Works Office was found dead after having complained of a sore throat the day before. The disease is now spreading throughout the court, and several more are already showing symptoms."
 byz_faction.a.52: "Flee to a countryside province"
 byz_faction.b.52: "We shall remain in the capital"
 byz_faction.t.53: "Daggers in the Dark"
 byz_faction.d.53: "A scream echoes through the palace, but soon dissolves again into the silence and black of the night. A courtier has been murdered, found in his bedchamber with a blade buried deep in his back, and several stab wounds to the rest of his body. Fratricide and internal strife are becoming ever more common in $COUNTRY$, and many believe that you are no longer true Emperor. There are three suspects in the murder case, who did it?"
 byz_faction.a.53: "The Palace Chef, in the Bedchamber, with a knife"
 byz_faction.b.53: "The Grand Secretary, in the Bedchamber, with a knife"
 byz_faction.c.53: "The Grand Marshal, in the Bedchamber, with a knife"
 byz_faction.t.54: "The Concubine's Child"
 byz_faction.d.54: "For the past nine months you have been an expecting father, and today one of your concubines did indeed give birth to a son. The joy is cut short, however, when the child is brought before you. His face is deformed into what looks like a permanent scream, and soft, black furlike hair grows in patches over his little body. The child is deformed, and your physician suspects that the deformity has affected his mental capacities as well. Various courtiers are willing to give you advice."
 byz_faction.a.54: "Diplomatic Senator"
 byz_faction.b.54: "General"
 byz_faction.c.54: "Administrative Senator"
 byz_faction.t.55: "A Riding Accident"
 byz_faction.d.55: "They present your heir on a stretcher, lying dead before you. He had been out riding with some of his companions, and apparently fell off the horse. You can feel only a quiet rage welling up within you when you think of the futility of his death. The son of the Emperor, dead, not in war or battle, but from a pointless accident. The event is a clear sign that our dynasty are in danger. His companions are from various demes, who should be punished for the incident?"

 byz_faction.d.56: "The Grand Secretaries have recently delivered their reports on the past years' advancements within their respective areas of expertise, and there is dire news. One of the Offices has significantly lowered their estimates of the rate of future progress, and the deme responsible for that department is bound to lose a great deal of face over the event.

 byz_faction.b.56: "Office of Taxation & Trade"
 byz_faction.c.56: "Office of War"
 byz_faction.t.57: "Gold turns to Lead"
 byz_faction.d.57: "A shocking discovery has been made in the Imperial treasury today, as several bars of gold have turned out to be nothing save cheap lead. The Grand Secretary responsible for the treasury, an Admiral, claims that the Gold must have been transmuted into lead, and hints that it might be a sign from the heavens that our reign no longer enjoys the blessing of God. The less fantastical explanation -- that someone has swindled the treasury -- does not seem to have occurred to him. What shall we do?"
 byz_faction.a.57: "Blast! The gold must have transmuted"
 byz_faction.b.57: "Traitors! Execute the Grand Secretary"
 byz_faction.t.58: "Grand Secretary Howls at the Moon"
 byz_faction.d.58: "Queer noises have been coming from the villa of one of the Grand Secretaries during the night lately, increasing in intensity and strength with each passing month. Initially you put it down to some intricate playtime with one of his concubines, but recently it has begun to dawn on you that there is a remarkable connection between the lunar phase and the noises. A spy sent into the garden on a full moon night returns with disturbing news"
 byz_faction.a.58: "Sha-la-la-la!"
 byz_faction.b.58: "He has taken the law and thrown it away!"
 byz_faction.t.59: "Tax Barge Sinks"
 byz_faction.d.59: "Terrible news reach us from the Bosporus, where one of the Tax barges, carrying a substantial amount of the taxes for $YEAR$, has sunk during a particularly nasty bout of bad weather. The Grand Secretary of the Treasury interprets these events as a sign that our dynasty no longer enjoys the blessing of God, and argues that we must accept and respect this turn of providence. How shall we respond to these ill tidings?"
 byz_faction.a.59: "Sigh. Not much to do, is there?"
 byz_faction.b.59: "Mint to recoup the losses."
 byz_faction.t.60: "False Edicts"
 byz_faction.d.60: "Several provinces have reported to the capital that they are now in full compliance with several sets of new imperial edicts, the only problem is that you've never issued any such edicts. An investigation into the matter reveals that several forged bronze plaques with written edicts, bearing your seal, have somehow found their way to the province governors. It is a dark time when people dare challenge the Emperor openly. What shall we do about these false edicts?"

Imperial Council demands $MONARCH$ to choose a heir from one of the previous Emperor's descendants - Angelos, Komnenos, Kantakouzenos or Doukas. But we can also invite a young male member of our distant relatives, thus keeping Palaiologos dynasty as imperial dynasty or inviting others to come.  The Angelos family was a noble Byzantine lineage which gave rise to three Byzantine emperors from 1185 to 1204. John VI Kantakouzenos, rose to be megas domestikos, regent, and eventually emperor (1341–1354) before resigning and retiring to a monastery after a failed civil war. Emperor Constantine X Doukas (r. 1059–1067) and his son ruled our Empire during late XI century. The Komnenos dynasty of Byzantine emperors was founded by Isaac I Komnenos in 1057.

Years of neglect had left the Empire in disarray, with a struggling economy, social unrest, and a military that was ill-prepared for any conflict.

It was clear that the monarch was no longer capable of ruling the empire. A replacement was needed, someone who could bring order and stability back to the Empire. The search for a suitable replacement began, and now we have three candidates."

 bogomilism_religion_desc: "Bogomilism was a dualist religiopolitical sect founded in the First Bulgarian Empire by the priest Bogomil during the reign of Tsar Peter I in the 10th century. It most probably arose in what is today the region of Macedonia as a response to the social stratification that occurred with the introduction of feudalism and as a form of political movement and opposition to the Bulgarian state and the church. The Bogomils called for a return to what they considered to be early spiritual teaching, rejecting the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and their primary political tendencies were resistance to the state and church authorities. This helped the movement spread quickly in the Balkans, gradually expanding throughout the Byzantine Empire and later reaching Kievan Rus', Bosnia, Dalmatia, Rascia, Italy, and France."

 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME1: "Emergence of Bogomilism"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC1: "A recently emerged Christian movement known as Bogomilism has been gaining followers among the common folk in some of our provinces. The followers calling themselves Friends of God believe in a dualistic world with two divine beings, God, the ruler of the spiritual world, and Satan, the ruler of the material world. Many Christians see this as antithetical to their monotheistic beliefs and the established Christian churches have denounced Bogomilism as heretical."
 et_bogomilism_events1.EVTOPT1: "We need to stop them."
 et_bogomilism_events1.EVTOPT2: "It's not our business."
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME2: "Spread of Bogomilism"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC2: "Bogomilism is slowly spreading in [Root.GetName] through its followers. Bogomilism rejects the ecclesiastical hierarchy, which helps them spreading among the peasantry."

 et_bogomilism_events2.EVTOPT2: "Wonderful."
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME3: "Question of Livestock"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC3: "Bogomilism rejects the consumption of meat. Also other animal products like cheese and milk are not allowed as they are by-products of sexual intercourse. Nevertheless, keeping livestock is how most people make their living in some parts of our country and some religious leaders demand we put an end to their sinful practice, but doing so would surely anger some people."
 et_bogomilism_events3.EVTOPT1: "Put an end to it."
 et_bogomilism_events3.EVTOPT2: "It certainly isn't pious, but it's not that important."
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME4: "A religious life for [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC4: "Recently our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has thought about living a more pious life and giving [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life a major religious direction. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] considered the possibility to either reduce [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] work as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and focussing on religious tasks more, such as praying. Another possibility that [Root.Monarch.GetName] considered was completely giving up [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and completely turn towards a religious, pious life. In that case [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] would abdicate and become a fully integrated member of the Bogomilist Church, which will allow [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to preach and perform rituals."
 et_bogomilism_events4.EVTOPT1: "[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] will live a more pious life. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] work as ruler will suffer from that."

 et_bogomilism_events4.EVTOPT3: "[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] will reconsider the choices and decide to focus on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] duty as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME5: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] displays unpious behavior"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC5: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has recently acted unpiously. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was, allegedly, seen eating meat by one of the courtiers. There were also rumors about corruption at the court and [Root.Monarch.GetName] being more interested in monetary than spiritual wealth."
 et_bogomilism_events5.EVTOPT1: "Perhaps I have been lacking fervor, but I vow to improve my behavior."
 et_bogomilism_events5.EVTOPT2: "Nonsense! Those are rumors, nothing else but slander!"

 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME6: "Support for the Preachers?"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC6: "Despite our faith rejecting the usual ecclesiastical hierarchy that other denominations follow, there still must be some difference between preachers and common people. Right now, many of our preachers want to slightly touch the structure of the church in order to better increase their influence on the common people. They now want their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to give them [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] support for their plan."
 et_bogomilism_events6.EVTOPT1: "Grant them our support."
 et_bogomilism_events6.EVTOPT2: "That's against our faith's principles. Maybe we should check what exactly they preach..."
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME7: "Complaint about a Local Preacher"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC7: "The people of [target_province.GetName] have complainted to us about their local preacher. It seems they consider his behavior a bit too harsh. They describe it as so focused on an ascetic lifestyle that the population is about to starve if they would all completely comply to him."
 et_bogomilism_events7.EVTOPT1: "There is nothing wrong with the preacher, he might even be too benevolent."
 et_bogomilism_events7.EVTOPT2: "Ascetic lifestyle is our principle. But that doesn't mean we should starve to death!"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME8: "The Situation of Lay Members"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC8: "In our faith there is a rather strict separation between lay members of the church and preachers. The ceremony to become a preacher takes up to a week and the regulations for preachers are much harder than for the common people. Even though we reject other general hierarchies within the church, like other Christian religions have, this is still something lay members occasionally complain about. It might be useful to slightly improve the standing of the lay members compared to the preachers, especially since we think everybody can find and teach the true knowledge."
 et_bogomilism_events8.EVTOPT1: "Everybody can teach. Their situation should be improved."
 et_bogomilism_events8.EVTOPT2: "Everybody can teach, but maybe not everybody should."
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME9: "A Sinful Nobility?"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC9: "There are movements in our country's nobility that want to push for changes to our faith's principles. The desire of the flesh, sexual contacts are strictly forbidden - even in marriage we just only tolerate it, to a degree. Certain nobles however fear for a loss of titles and loss of power for their family, if they are unable to secure their blood line - if necessary even with bastards!"
 et_bogomilism_events9.EVTOPT1: "The bloodline is pretty important, if you ask me."
 et_bogomilism_events9.EVTOPT2: "Unacceptable! They should be ashamed for their sinful wishes!"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME10: "The Church in [target_province.GetName]"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC10: "Our belief rejects the construction of churches. The human body is the temple of God, not a stone building.

In 867 the vengeful sons of Loðbrok and their 'Great Heathen Army' descended upon the petty kingdoms of Britain to make of Ælla a 'Blood Eagle'. Meanwhile, two other Norse lords - Rurik and Dyre - were carving out their own rival states among the Slavic and Finnish tribes of the East, laying down the foundations for what would one day become Russia. The Old Gods are still strong and their warriors mighty!"
 VIC2_NAME: "The Victorian Era"
 VIC2_DESC: "After the tribulations of Napoleon's wars, the consensus established at the Congress of Vienna has restored a tentative calm to a troubled continent. While the flames of revolution may have been put out for now, the ideas of human liberty, nationalism and liberalism will soon prove themselves more alive than ever. Princess Victoria is 16 years old, and will soon ascend to the throne of Great Britain, the greatest industrial empire ever to span the globe. Her ascension marks the beginning of an age that is to last all the way up until the First World War. In this new era of unprecedented technological progress, doubts will be cast on certainties that have stood since time immemorial, and new dogmas will rise in their place."
 WWI_NAME: "The First World War"
 WWI_DESC: "Although a resurgence of imperialism was an underlying cause, the immediate trigger for war was the 28 June 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo. This set off a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia, and international alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked. Within weeks, the major powers were at war and the conflict soon spread around the world."
 WWII_NAME: "The Second World War"
 WWII_DESC: "Adolf Hitler has turned the newly formed German republic into an authoritarian dictatorship and has annexed Austria and parts of Czechoslovakia. Finally the invasion of Poland forced The United Kingdom and France to declare war on Germany. Meanwhile in Asia, Japan is on its way on conquering China and with USA and Soviet Union likely to join the mayhem soon, this war is sure to become more global and bloody than any of the ones seen before."
 et_cathar.EVTNAME1: "Emergence of Catharism"
 et_cathar.EVTDESC1: "A recently emerged Christian movement known as Catharism has been gaining followers among the common folk in some of our provinces. The followers calling themselves Good Christians believe in a dualistic world with two divine beings, God the creator and satan the destroyer. Many Christians see this as antithetical to their monotheistic beliefs and the established Christian churches have denounced Catharism as heretical. The spread of this new religion could pose a threat on Papal authority in Europe if left unchecked."
 et_cathar.1.a: "We need to stop them."
 et_cathar.1.b: "It's not our business."
 et_cathar.EVTNAME2: "Spread of Catharism"
 et_cathar.EVTDESC2: "Catharism is slowly spreading in Western Europe through its followers. Unlike most forms of Christianity, Catharism allows women to serve as spiritual leaders which is helping it spread alomg women. The Cathars often find protection among the common people and are thus difficult to find and often get away with their actions against the Church."
 et_cathar.2.a: "Worrisome."
 et_cathar.2.b: "Good."
 et_cathar.EVTNAME3: "Question of Reform"
 et_cathar.EVTDESC3: "While Catharism holds the key to many truths, some of its more extreme beliefs may not be practical to enforce over all of society. For example many Cathars believe all human reproduction to be sinful, which could be detrimental for our country in the long term. Our secular advisors instruct us to reform the religion to tone down some of its more extreme beliefs."
 et_cathar.3.a: "Implement the reforms."
 et_cathar.3.b: "We shall not stray from the true faith."
 et_cathar.EVTNAME4: "Albigensian Crusade"
 et_cathar.EVTDESC4: "The heretical movement Catharism is spreading uncontrolled and converting many Christians to their ranks. The Pope as the head of Catholicism, the true faith, has to find the means to stop this heresy from spreading further. A crusade where all loyal Catholic rulers join together to defeat the Cathars could be an effective solution."
 et_cathar.4.a: "Call for a crusade!"
 et_cathar.4.b: "We should be more cautious."
 et_cathar.EVTNAME5: "Albigensian Crusade"
 et_cathar.EVTDESC5: "The Pope has declared a crusade against the Cathars and requested all Catholic rulers to take part in eliminating any Cathar minorities in their borders and taking war to countries who protect them. Now it is up to us to decide if we want to take part in protecting the integrity of the Catholic faith."
 et_cathar.5.a: "Support the crusade."
 et_cathar.5.b: "It's not our business."
 cathar_aspect_endura: "Endura"
 desc_cathar_aspect_endura: "Sick or dying people who only decide at the end of their lives to receive the Consolamentum, but who no longer have the opportunity to live a strict ascetic life as Perfecti, can still save their souls by not eating any more food and thus starving to death."
 cathar_aspect_consolamentum: "Consolamentum"
 desc_cathar_aspect_consolamentum: "The Consolamentum is the crucial step in becoming a member of the Cathar Church and the only way to achieve salvation. If believers want to receive the consolamentum, they are required to prepare themselves in a kind of novitiate for the life of a Cathar. After the baptism the new member of the movement must live the rest of his life as a Cathar in order to attain salvation. Anyone who has received the consolamentum can pass it on, i.e. accept other people into the Cathar Church and thus save their souls."
 cathar_aspect_support_of_the_nobility: "Support of the Nobility"
 desc_cathar_aspect_support_of_the_nobility: "In the early days, the Cathar faith had strong support among the local nobility."
 cathar_aspect_generous_donations: "Generous Donations"
 desc_cathar_aspect_generous_donations: "Despite the fact that the faithful lived in personal poverty, the Cathar Church was able to amass considerable wealth - above all through donations made to the community at the sick or deathbed in the course of conferring the consolamentum, often in the form of substantial sums or the transfer of the entire heritage."
 cathar_aspect_allowed_interest: "Allowed Interest"
 desc_cathar_aspect_allowed_interest: "In contrast to other Christian faiths, interests are not banned."
 cathar_aspect_cathar_hierarchy: "Cathar Hierarchy"
 desc_cathar_aspect_cathar_hierarchy: "Due to its strict hierarchy, it had only a small lead, the bishops and their deputies, and led from them to a broad base, the credentes and sympathizers. Its tight organization gave the Cathar Church great potency and clout."
 cathar_aspect_perfecti: "Perfecti"
 desc_cathar_aspect_perfecti: "The Perfecti form the hard core of the actual members of the Cathar Church. They are permitted to say the Lord's Prayer and to give the Consolamentum. They live a chaste and simple to ascetic life in personal poverty with many fasting rules."
 cathar_aspect_pacifism: "Pacifism"
 desc_cathar_aspect_pacifism: "War and capital punishment are condemned in the Cathar Church."
 cathar_aspect_equality_of_men_and_women: "Equality of Men and Women"
 desc_cathar_aspect_equality_of_men_and_women: "Catharism has been seen as giving women the greatest opportunities for independent action, since women were found as being believers as well as Perfecti, who were able to administer the sacrament of the consolamentum. Catharism attracted numerous women with the promise of a leadership role that the Catholic Church did not allow."
 cathar_aspect_ascetic_lifestyle: "Ascetic Lifestyle"
 desc_cathar_aspect_ascetic_lifestyle: "The followers of the Cathar faith live a simple, ascetic life in personal poverty."
 cathar_aspect_fortress_churches: "Fortress Churches"

 et_cults.1.t: "Celebrating Yennayer"
 et_cults.1.d: "Yennayer is the first day of the agrarian year used since antiquity by Amazigh people of North Africa. It corresponds to the first day of January of the Julian Calendar. This is a widespread celebration, during which some rituals take place, mostly operations of cleansing and animal sacrifices. For this year, your advisors have suggested you take an active part in preparing the celebrations. Our people would be very grateful."
 et_cults.1.a: "Join in the celebrations"
 et_cults.1.b: "I have more important things to do!"
 et_cults.3.t: "Restoring the Madghacen"
 et_cults.3.d: "The Madghacen is a royal mausoleum-temple of the Numidian Kings, dating from the third century BC. It is a gigantic dome ringed with columns, which is the oldest preserved ancient royal mausoleum in North Africa. However, this magnificent monument is in great danger. Damaged by the ravages of time, weather and looters, the building is at risk of collapse, which would anger the ancestral spirits living in it. It is our duty to help in its restoration to keep our ancestors happy."
 et_cults.3.a: "We must restore this monument!"
 et_cults.3.b: "Nah... These are just old stones."
 et_cults.4.t: "Building a Pyramid"
 et_cults.4.d: "It is important for our $MONARCHTITLE$ to have a luxurious life after death. The traditional tombs and burial mounds are not enough to display the glory of our leaders. For this, we need bigger, more advanced tombs such as pyramids, where the $MONARCHTITLE$ can be buried along with all his most important personal items. Should we build a pyramid for our great $MONARCHTITLE$ so that the glory of his reign can be remembered eternally?"
 et_cults.4.a: "Let us build a big one."
 et_cults.4.b: "A traditional tomb will do."
 et_cults.5.t: "Tislit n Anzar"

 et_cults.5.b: "I wish I could, but I don't want to."
 et_cults.6.t: "A Night With the Dead"
 et_cults.6.d: "In the cult of the dead, the ancestors are deified and revered. When someone wants to invoke them to ask something, he sleeps in their mausoleums so that they will receive answers in their dreams. While you go through a bad patch, you think about the idea of spending a night among your ancestors. Do you feel ready to share your doubts with the rulers of distant past?"
 et_cults.6.a: "I am sure my ancestors will answer my call."
 et_cults.6.b: "Uh... This idea sounds a little too creepy."
 et_cults.7.t: "A Night With the Dead"
 et_cults.7.d: "You went into the tomb of your ancestors. It took you a long time to fall sleep, because the idea of being among deceased people did not particularly please you. After a long night, you woke up with no answers to your questions. However, you caught a beautiful cold from the cold and humid air of the tomb. You will be in bed for several days, but your people are happy that you have honored their traditions."
 et_cults.7.a: "Achoo!"
 et_cults.8.t: "A Night With the Dead"
 et_cults.8.d: "You went into the tomb of your ancestors. It took you a long time to fall sleep, because the idea of being among deceased people did not particularly please you. After a long night, you woke up with the feeling of having acquired the knowledge of your ancestors. You come out of the grave smiling, ready to lead your nation to glory."
 et_cults.8.a: "Fantastic!"
 et_cults.9.t: "A Night With the Dead"
 et_cults.9.d: "Last night, our $MONARCHTITLE$ entered the tomb of his ancestors. However, in the morning, one of the guards guarding the tomb found the $MONARCHTITLE$ dead on the tomb floor. No one knows what happened. Maybe an assassin was able to sneak into the tomb, or maybe this is a sign from the ancestors that someone else would be better suited to rule us."
 et_cults.9.a: "Fant... Wait, what do you mean by 'Our leader is dead'?"
 et_cults.10.t: "Affinities With Hellenism"
 et_cults.10.d: "Our people are worshipping Saturn and some other gods of Roman origin. This has been noticed by some of our neighbours who worship the same gods, which has made them consider our cultures to be closer to each other and think of us as more civilized than other African tribes. This has improved our diplomatic relations with them."

 et_cults.11.t: "Affinities With Egyptian Religion"
 et_cults.11.d: "Our people are worshipping Ammon and some other gods of Egyptian origin.

One of our statesmen has proposed Waterloo as the site for our new capital, and he wants to rename it 'Austin', after our founding father, Stephen Austin. Shall we move our capital westwards?"

The second faction, led by Mirabeau B. Lamar, wants Texas to not only remain independent, but to also push westwards towards the Pacific Ocean. Texas now finds itself at a crossroads. We can either give up our sovereignty to the United States, or pursue our own destiny. If we refuse this annexation and try to forge our own path, the United States will begin to see us as a rival, rather than as a friend."

They have come to the conclusion that if we take the initiative, we can dominate; but if we do not, we will be dominated. They also believe that the shogunate is too isolationist, too stuck in its old ways to take the correct action to reform Japan and remain competitive against our rivals. Some of our subjects have formed an alliance to overthrow the shogunate to make Japan more open to foreign trade and to start adopting various western technological discoveries into the Japanese society.

The shogunate has so far not been too amused by the idea of trading with foreign countries, but the forces supporting the emperor have shown interest in opening Japan up more, so we can gain financially from the emperor winning the civil war. Offering support to the rebels will surely anger the shogun, but if the Emperor manages to defeat him, he will surely remember the aid we provided and reward us."

Early during in regency for Emperor [Root.Heir.GetName] they managed to gain control of the regency council to become the sole regents of Japan. [Root.Heir.GetName] is now close to reaching adulthood, and when that happens the Fujiwara would be expected to hand the power back to the Emperor. However, we have now learned that the Fujiwara are planning to depose [Root.Heir.GetName] in favor of a younger, weaker emperor while they still hold the power. This would extend the regency, leaving the Fujiwara in power for longer. If we allow this plan to go on unchecked, the Fujiwara regency could go on indefinitely, turning the Emperor into a powerless puppet. However, there is little we can do about it while the Emperor is not of age. The imperial armies are loyal to the Fujiwara and would certainly protect them from any attempts to overthrow them. All we can do is ask the other noble clans for help, as with their combined armies we would be able to defeat the Fujiwara. However, the other nobles will not be willing to help us without compensation. To get their support, we need to offer them greater autonomy over their lands."

 et_islam.3.d: "Some of the tribes that submitted to Muhammad did so only because he was the prophet of Allah. Now with Mohammad dead, these tribes claim [Root.Monarch.GetName] has no authority over them. Instead these tribes have pledged allegiance to various false prophets.

 et_islam.3.a: "So be it."
 et_islam.4.t: "Death of Abu Bakr"
 et_islam.4.d: "The righteously guided Caliph, Abu Bakr has died. Since his death was preceded by a period of illness, he could see his end coming and on his deathbed had appointed 'Umar as his rightful successor. With Abu Bakr's will known by all Muslim leaders, no other candidates have come up."

 et_islam.5.a: "Horror!"
 et_islam.6.t: "Death of 'Umar"
 et_islam.6.d: "Caliph 'Umar has died. Due to the sudden nature of his death he was unable to name a successor before his death, instead leaving the responsibility of designatating the next Caliph to a council of the most trusted Muslim leaders. Two names rise above the others in these discussions"

After continued negotiations, however, Ali has reluctantly agreed to take the responsibility."
 et_islam.7.a: "Ali shall be the next Caliph then."
 et_islam.8.t: "Battle of the Camel"
 et_islam.8.d: "Despite [Root.Monarch.GetName] having been rightfully chosen as the ruler of all Muslims, some prominent Muslim figures disagree with his appointment, chief among them being Talhah and Al-Zubayr. Together with Aisha, Muhammad's widow, they marched to meet a group of Kharijite rebels that [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s troops had already met. Tensions were high as all three armies met, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] managed to convince Talhah and Al-Zubayr to retreat without fight. However, the armies of Aisha, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the Kharijtes instead ended up clashing and during the conflict, Kharijite troops tracked down and killed both Talhah and Al-Zubayr. Fortunately, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was able to end the conflict without too much bloodshed by shooting down and dismembering the camel Aisha was mounted on and capturing Aisha. Since she is highly respected by many, [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided to release Aisha to not create further divisions in the Muslim world."
 et_islam.8.a: "Troubling."
 et_islam.9.t: "Death of Ali"
 et_islam.9.d: "Our Caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib has died. Ali had not appointed a successor, but he had multiple times expressed that only relatives of the prophet should be able to lead Muslims. Therefore, Ali's supporters unanimously supported Hasan, as he was the eldest son of Ali and a grandson of Muhammad via his daughter Fatimah."
 et_islam.9.a: "Long live Hasan!"
 et_islam.10.t: "Conflict with Kharijites"
 et_islam.10.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been assassinated and we have managed to trace the assassin to the Kharijite movement. The Kharijites had formerly been loyal to [Root.Monarch.GetName], but now with the Caliph assassinated they have risen in open rebellion against us."
 et_islam.10.a: "They will pay for their treachery!"
 et_islam.11.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]-Muawiya Treaty"
 et_islam.11.d: "Despite the open conflict between [Root.Monarch.GetName] and Muawiya, peace negotiations have been going on in the background as both agree the state of civil war is not good for the Caliphate. Muawiya has proposed a treaty to end the civil war, but the terms are harsh. Muawiya demands for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to abdicate and for himself to be named Caliph. In return he agrees to not name a successor for himself, but instead a neutral third party will choose the successor for Muawiya. Finally Muawiya agrees to end cursing the name of the former Caliph, Ali and promises to ensure the safety of all Muslims, including the followers of Ali."

 et_islam.13.t: "Sunni-Shia Split"
 et_islam.13.d: "Following the treaty Muawiya signed with the previous Caliph, Muawiya got the title of Caliph on the condition he would not name a successor for himself. However, not soon after this Muawiya has assigned his own son as his heir and declared the office of Caliph a hereditary position. This blatant violation of the treaty has greatly upset the Shiite followers of Ali, causing them to no longer consider Muawiya the legitimate Caliph and split off to form a separate branch of Islam."
 et_islam.13.a: "These heretics will be put down."
 et_islam.14.t: "Sunni-Shia Split"
 et_islam.14.d: "Certain groups within the Caliphate have become concerned by Ali's son becoming the next Caliph after him. Some of the rebels joined Muawiya precisely because they thought Ali's followers would end up dominating the Caliphate, but by rallying their armies against the Caliphate they are sealing that fate themselves as only those loyal to Ali remain on our side. With this, the Caliphate will be dominated by Ali's dynasty long into the future even if the position of Caliph will still remain nominally elective. The Sunnis who oppose the dominance of Ali' followers have thus been declared heretical."
 et_islam.14.a: "These heretics will be put down."

 et_christian.4.d: "Jan Hus was a Czech preacher who attracted a large following for himself, but recently he was put on trial accused of heresy.

Saint Olga of Kiev was a regent ruler of the Kievan Rus' and was among the first converts to Christianity in Eastern Europe. Upon traveling to Constantinople, Olga had converted with the assistance of the Emperor and the Patriarch. While the Christianization of the Rus was only truly realized by her grandson Vladimir the Great, Olga was the first from Rus' to enter the kingdom of God. Thanks to her efforts to convert the people of the Rus,' she has been given the honorific Isapóstolos, meaning 'Equal to the Apostles.'"
 personal_deities_orthodox_icons_events_mmetr.1.a: "May we spread the true faith in emulation of Saint Olga"

 et_gbr.1.d: "French is already a common language among the ruling class, but our country is still considered British."
 et_gbr.1.a: "We will keep our culture."
 et_gbr.1.b: "Let us embrace French culture."
 red_turbans.1.t: "The Red Turban Rebellion"
 red_turbans.1.desc: "The Red Turban movement has for years been gaining traction within China with their religious teachings, but now it has started a mass mobilization of workers from the farming population with the intention of overthrowing our rule over China and returning it to Chinese control. We must protect the empire until we can break the rebels' resistance and defeat their leaders."
 red_turbans.1.a: "We must defend the empire!"
 red_turbans.2.t: "End of the Revolts"
 red_turbans.2.desc: "We have finally managed to defeat the rebel forces and execute their leaders, securing our rule over China."
 red_turbans.2.a: "Great!"
 red_turbans.3.t: "This is getting out of control"
 red_turbans.3.desc: "Many Chinese peasants are feeling our rule over China weakening and are growing bolder in their resistance. Yet more rebels have joined the Red Turbans."
 red_turbans.3.a: "Defend the empire at all costs!"
 red_turbans.8.t: "Mistreatment of the Han People"
 red_turbans.8.desc: "Through decades of domination over China, many Han Chinese have felt our leaders treating them poorly. They have been given only very limited power in the administration of our empire, and payed little attention to Chinese climatology and economic difficulties. Numerous taxes on Chinese regions to fund our occupation across the continent and the construction of numerous palaces have significantly jeopardized our stability and is contributing heavily to the ongoing rebellions in Chinese territories."
 red_turbans.8.a: "We are the rightful rulers of China"
 red_turbans.9.t: "Rampant corruption"
 red_turbans.9.desc: "Ever since we established our rule in China, corruption has been a significant issue. Corrupt officials exist at all levels, from local to central government. Even the ministers in the court are suspected of being involved in these kinds of practices. Our rulers have implemented policies to reduce corruption, such as detailing rules of censorship and inspection related to corruption crimes. However, these efforts have not proven successful."
 red_turbans.9.a: "This can not be tolerated"
 red_turbans.11.t: "White Lotus Society"
 red_turbans.11.desc: "The evident discontent of the Chinese population towards our dynasty and the recent natural disasters that have occurred have led to the emergence of secret sects with the objective of conspiracy and overthrowing our rule over China. Although we have banned these practices and attempted to disband these groups, they have gone underground and have continued to operate from the shadows, recruiting more people to their cause. The White Lotus sect is believed to include many influential people in China who we have previously thought to be loyal to us."
 red_turbans.11.a: "Suspicious"
 red_turbans.12.t: "High Inflation"
 red_turbans.12.desc: "Our leaders and upper classes have been indiscriminately printing paper currency, which has significantly increased inflation. The empire's currency has devalued greatly, leading to widespread discontent with our rule. It is known that these practices have been carried out to benefit the courts and the upper classes, but the lower classes and traders have seen their businesses harmed. As a result, they have sought alternative forms of exchange based on silver or gold, a practice that has also been prohibited by our government. This situation is bound to worsen."
 red_turbans.12.a: "That's nonsense."
 red_turbans.13.t: "The Black Death"
 red_turbans.13.desc: "For many months now, numerous outbreaks of a new disease have been detected, claiming a significant percentage of the population in some Chinese cities. Many people have taken this as a sign that we are not the rightful possessors of the Mandate of Heaven, and in the eyes of the Chinese, we do not deserve to rule them without divine protection. Let's hope that this does not result in further unrest."
 red_turbans.13.a: "Curses!"
 red_turbans.14.t: "Rise of General Zhu Yuanzhang"
 red_turbans.14.desc: "We have heard that rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang is preparing an army to take control of China and establish his government under the Ming dynasty. Apparently, he is a member of the White Lotus Society who has gained some prominence and wants to seize this moment of weakness to assert himself against his Han rivals and our government. The belief that we are not the chosen ones to govern this empire is deeply ingrained in Chinese society. Now, all that remains is to resist and fight."
 red_turbans.14.a: "We must destroy them"
 red_turbans.15.t: "Han Uprising"
 red_turbans.15.desc: "Many generals have taken advantage of our weakened state and are attempting to overthrow our government at all costs. Following the ancient tradition of the turbans and invoking their legacy, as well as the symbolic and historical significance of the Yellow River for the Han people and China, numerous organized uprisings of Chinese peasants led by generals have been detected. These generals aim to bring back the ancient splendor of the Han dynasty. These guerrilla groups base their attacks on our government's poor management, discrimination, and mistreatment of the Han people, as well as the numerous disasters that have occurred in recent years, including numerous Yellow River floods. At least we know they are not allies of the Ming"
 red_turbans.15.a: "Another one?"
 red_turbans.16.t: "Ming Rebels"
 red_turbans.16.desc: "My lord, we have detected that many peasants and factions allied with the Ming are revolting in some provinces of the empire. Our authorities are unable to contain them in the area, but we must bring reinforcements as soon as possible."
 red_turbans.16.a: "They seek the mandate of heaven"
 red_turbans.17.t: "Flood"
 red_turbans.17.desc: "My lord, we have been informed of new massive floods in certain areas of China. In these cases, it seems that not even the heavens are on our side. Let's hope that these disasters do not provoke further reprisals."
 red_turbans.17.a: "Unfortunate"
 red_turbans.18.t: "Chinese Warlord of Wu"
 red_turbans.18.desc: "My lord, we have been informed that a Chinese general named Zhang Shicheng has gained significant support among the population in eastern China and has defeated our troops stationed there. This general was one of those who witnessed the disasters of the Yellow River, and taking advantage of the population's discontent with us, he has decided to proclaim independence for that territory under the title of 'King of Wu.' We must deal with him and his army before these rebellions become a trend. Fortunately, he appears to be in conflict with other Chinese warlords."
 red_turbans.18.a: "We will defeat them"
 red_turbans.19.t: "Chinese Warlord of Xia"
 red_turbans.19.desc: "My lord, our garrisons in the western part of China have been defeated. It seems that a Chinese warlord named Ming Yuzhen has managed to secure a military victory in the city of Chongqing, allowing him to proclaim the independence of that territory under the title of 'Emperor of the Great Xia.' This guerrilla group appears to be supportive of the Ming, although they are also willing to go to war to secure the Mandate of Heaven over China. Apparently, this warlord also hails from the White Lotus sect and has garnered enough support to keep us in trouble. This trend is dangerous."
 red_turbans.19.a: "We will defeat them"
 red_turbans.20.t: "Chinese Warlord of Han"
 red_turbans.20.desc: "My lord, our troops in the Hunan region have been defeated, and it appears that another Chinese warlord from the White Lotus Society, Han Shantong, is responsible. He, along with the revived Han dynasty and other warlords like Xu Da and Chang Yuchun, is attempting to take control not only of areas we control but also of the other disintegrated independent Chinese states. At this point, it has turned into a full-fledged civil war for the throne of China, and we are not in a favorable position to combat all these enemies simultaneously. Our troops are exhausted, and our reserves are limited."
 red_turbans.20.a: "We will defeat them"
 red_turbans.21.t: "Chinese Warlord of Ming"
 red_turbans.21.desc: "My lord, we have lost control of another region in the central China, this time the warlords have defeated our troops in Jiangxi and Anhui and have proclaimed the Ming dynasty. This rebellion seems to be particularly strong compared to the previous ones, although it is not clear who is leading it. These Chinese rulers are certainly members of the White Lotus Society, who detest our government and want to depose Togon Temur Khan. They are against our policies regarding the Han ethnicity and China, and they believe that we are not protected by divinity."
 red_turbans.21.a: "We will defeat them"
 red_turbans.22.t: "Chinese Warlord of Min"
 red_turbans.22.desc: "We have lost control of the area of Fujian. With our local rule collapsed a rebel warlord has claimed the region as his own, establishing a new kingdom in the area."
 red_turbans.22.a: "We will defeat them"
 red_turbans.23.t: "Chinese Volunteers"
 red_turbans.23.desc: "Chinese volunteers from the former Jin dynasty regions are offering their support. They harbor deep resentment towards the Han due to the ongoing ethnic discrimination they suffered in the past. Historically they have fought the Han for control of China, and now, some of them feel more comfortable with us staying in power. We should seize this opportunity."

Our neighbors are conspiring against us, while some of them are in awe and some of them are in fear. We could affirm our strength here, and go forth and claim a glorious empire! However, that is not without risks. Another, safer option would be to use our power to strongarm some of our neighbors into becoming our subjects, although this would be to the defecit of our prestige. We could also back down entirely, and attempt to make concessions to the nations damaged by our conquests. This would look good diplomatically, but hurt our prestige within the tribe."

 desc_new_world_i: "The discovery of the New World has heralded a new era not only for the colonizers and the colonized, it has lead to a spread of materials and techniques as well as a realization of the vast size of the globe. As animals, crop types, silver and diseases spread across the Atlantic the first steps have been taken towards a truly global economy and as foreign lands and people are mapped and documented ideas as well as religious and philosophical debate has become more and more colored by what we have found in overseas societies. Great minds feel the need to question what was once truth and from Valladolid to Fatehpur Sikri the nature of the world is now up for debate."
 desc_writing: "As human societies emerged, the development of writing was driven by pragmatic exigencies such as exchanging information, maintaining financial accounts, codifying laws and recording history. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in Mesopotamia outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form. Even millenia after its invention writing remains one of the most important requirements for the emergence civilized societies and great technological and intellectual achievements would be impossile without it."
 desc_legalism: "Legalism is a classical school of Chinese philosophy that groups thinkers crucial to laying the 'intellectual and ideological foundations of the traditional bureaucratic empire'. Often compared with modern social sciences, they have been regarded as having three tendencies"
 desc_ancient_imperialism: "Imperialism is a policy that means extending a country's power through military and diplomacy. Its name originates from the Latin word imperium, which means to rule over large territories. Generally this means a multi-ethnic or multinational state with political and military dominion of populations who are culturally and ethnically distinct from the ruling imperial ethnic group and its culture. The Romans were the first nation to invent and embody the concept of empire in their two mandates"
 desc_caste_system: "Caste is a form of social stratification characterized by endogamy, hereditary transmission of a lifestyle which often includes an occupation, ritual status in a hierarchy, and customary social interaction and exclusion based on cultural notions of purity and pollution. Its paradigmatic ethnographic example is the division of society into rigid social groups, with roots in ancient history and persisting until today. Sometimes, sociologists and anthropologists study the caste-like social divisions existing in various countries by using the Indian caste system as an analogical basis for research."
 desc_organized_religion: "Organized religion, also known as institutional religion, is religion as a social institution, in which belief systems and rituals are systematically arranged and formally established. Organized religion is typically characterized by an official doctrine or dogma, a hierarchical or bureaucratic leadership structure, and a codification of rules and practices. Due to their structured, standardized, and so easily proliferated form, organized religions comprise many of the world's major religious groups."
 desc_serfdom: "Serfdom is a condition of bondage, which developed primarily during the High Middle Ages in Europe and lasted in some countries until the mid-19th century. Serfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the lord of the manor who owned that land, and in return were entitled to protection, justice and the right to exploit certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence. Serfs were often required not only to work on the lord's fields, but also his mines, forests and roads. The manor formed the basic unit of feudal society, and the lord of the manor and his serfs were bound legally, economically, and socially. Serfs formed the lowest social class of feudal society."
 desc_manorialism: "Manorialism was the organizing principle of rural economy that originated in the villa system of the Late Roman Empire. It was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central Europe, and was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract. Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor, supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor, and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court. These obligations could be payable in several ways, in labor, in kind, or, on rare occasions, in coin."
 desc_early_feudalism: "The classic version of feudalism describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of lords, vassals and fiefs. A lord was in broad terms a noble who held land, a vassal was a person who was granted possession of the land by the lord, and the land was known as a fief. In exchange for the use of the fief and the protection of the lord, the vassal would provide some sort of service to the lord. There were many varieties of feudal land tenure, consisting of military and non-military service. The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship."
 desc_crop_rotation: "Agriculturalists have long recognized that suitable rotations - such as planting spring crops for livestock in place of grains for human consumption - make it possible to restore or to maintain a productive soil. Middle Eastern farmers already practised crop rotation in 6000 BC without understanding the chemistry, alternately planting legumes and cereals. From the times of Charlemagne, farmers in Europe transitioned from a two-field crop rotation to a three-field crop rotation. From the end of the Middle Ages until the 20th century, Europe's farmers practised three-field rotation, dividing available lands into three parts. One section was planted in the autumn with rye or winter wheat, followed by spring oats or barley; the second section grew crops such as peas, lentils, or beans; and the third field was left fallow."
 desc_civil_service: "The origin of the modern meritocratic civil service can be traced back to Imperial examination founded in Imperial China. The Imperial exam based on merit was designed to select the best administrative officials for the state's bureaucracy. This system had a huge influence on both society and culture in Imperial China and was directly responsible for the creation of a class of scholar-bureaucrats irrespective of their family pedigree. In theory, the civil service system provided one of the major outlets for social mobility in medieval societies, although in practice, due to the time-consuming nature of the study, the examination was generally only taken by sons of the elite."
 desc_manuscripts: "Manuscript culture uses manuscripts to store and disseminate information; in the West, it generally preceded the age of printing. In early manuscript culture, monks copied manuscripts by hand. They copied not just religious works, but a variety of texts including some on astronomy, herbals, and bestiaries. Medieval manuscript culture deals with the transition of the manuscript from the monasteries to the market in the cities, and the rise of universities. Manuscript culture in the cities created jobs built around the making and trade of manuscripts, and typically was regulated by universities."
 desc_scholasticism: "Scholasticism is a method of critical thought which dominated teaching by the academics of medieval universities in Europe from about 1100 to 1700, and a program of employing that method in articulating and defending dogma in an increasingly pluralistic context. It originated as an outgrowth of and a departure from Christian monastic schools at the earliest European universities. The first institutions in the West to be considered universities were established in Italy, France, Spain, and England in the late 11th and the 12th centuries for the study of arts, law, medicine, and theology, such as Schola Medica Salernitana, the University of Bologna, and the University of Paris."
 desc_guilds: "Guilds are associations of artisans or merchants who control the practice of their craft in a particular town. The earliest types of guild were formed as confraternities of tradesmen. They were organized in a manner something between a professional association, trade union, a cartel, and a secret society. They often depended on grants of letters patent by a monarch or other authority to enforce the flow of trade to their self-employed members, and to retain ownership of tools and the supply of materials. A lasting legacy of traditional guilds are the guildhalls constructed and used as meeting places. An important result of the guild framework was the emergence of universities in medieval Europe."
 desc_medicine: "The major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection, especially during the Black Death in the 14th and 15th centuries, of what may be called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general such as Copernicus's rejection of Ptolemy's theories on astronomy). Physicians like Vesalius improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past. The main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were Materia Medica and Pharmacopoeia."
 desc_imperialism: "Imperialism is a policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization, use of military force, or other means. Imperialism is particularly focused on the control that one group, often a state power, has on another group of people. This is often through various forms of 'othering' based on racial, religious, or cultural stereotypes. The Age of Imperialism, a time period beginning around 1700, saw European industrializing nations, engaging in the process of colonizing, influencing, and annexing other parts of the world in order to gain political power. Imperialism has been subject to moral or immoral censure by its critics, but it has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas into colonial territories."
 desc_industrialization: "The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British."
 desc_nationalism_institution: "Nationalism is a shared group feeling in the significance of a geographical and sometimes demographic region seeking independence for its culture or ethnicity that holds that group together. This can be expressed as a belief or political ideology that involves an individual identifying with or becoming attached to one's nation. The early emergence of a popular patriotic nationalism took place in the mid-18th century, and was actively promoted by the European governments and by the writers and intellectuals of the time. National symbols, anthems, myths, flags and narratives were assiduously constructed and adopted. The political development of nationalism and the push for popular sovereignty culminated with the national revolutions of Europe, such as the Greek War of Independence of 1821–1829. Since that time, nationalism has become one of the most significant political and social forces in history."
 desc_electrification: "Electrification is the build out of the electrical generating and distribution systems which occurred in Britain, the United States, and other countries from the mid-1880s until around 1950. Although early electricity was very expensive compared to today, it was far cheaper and more convenient than oil, steam power or manual labor making the period of electrification of factories and households one of high productivity and economic growth. Some experts consider electrification the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th Century."
 desc_globalization: "Globalization is the process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views, products, ideas, and other aspects of culture. Advances in transportation and in telecommunications infrastructure have been major factors in globalization, generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century and throughout 20th century the connectivity of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly."
 desc_internet: "The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that links billions of devices worldwide. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web, electronic mail, newsgroups, voice over IP telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States federal government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks. Internet use grew rapidly in the West from the mid-1990s and from the late 1990s in the developing world. In the 20 years since 1995, Internet use has grown 100-times."

An important aspect of the Lollard faith is the striving for apostolic poverty, combined with the taxation of the clergy. Furthermore the Lollards don't believe that the church practices of baptism and confession are necessary for salvation. Confession to a priest is seen as unnecessary, because a priest doesn't have the ability to forgive one's sins. Lollards are pacifist and reject the idea of war, especially the idea of Crusades against heathens.

 reformation_jhn_desc: "Many Koreanic speakers continue to enter our lands, gradually changing the very fabric of our society, and bringing innovations such as the increased use of iron. We face a choice, between on one hand adapting our society to these newcomers, likely losing part of our land to the growing state of Saro-guk (Silla) but strengthening our position through adoption of the new forms of administration, or on the other hand enforcing our heritage, while risking becoming an anachronism."

Chinese goods and knowledge flow into Jinhan and the others, and our societies are experiencing rapid change and development. With this newfound prosperity comes danger, however. The Han could cut off the flow of goods again, as Wiman did, or they could send troops further into Korea to extend their authority. We must keep the Chinese giant on good terms."
 seek_allies_jhn_title: "Seek Allies"
 seek_allies_jhn_desc: "Jinhan is not as strong as Mahan, and certainly not as strong as Han or Goguryeo. To survive, Jinhan must expand, and the best way to do so is by finding allies. The northern states of Mahan have been raided by Mohe tribes for centuries, perhaps these tribes could accomplish far more with our support. Alternatively, Baekje could be approached, and given support against Mokji so that our nations could split Mahan between us. Finally, there’s the option of a Japanese ally, made easier by the cultural similarities which remain between our peoples."
 conquer_byeonhan_jhn_title: "Conquer Byeonhan"
 conquer_byeonhan_jhn_desc: "The people of Byeonhan have a very similar culture to our own, and our two confederacies belonged to the same state under the Kingdom of Jin.

Each of the original twelve had from 600-5000 families, but those in newly conquered Byeonhan are generally smaller, and none of the statelets except Saro are as developed as we would like. To strengthen our position, we ought to encourage those from other lands to come here and settle, and so allow us to become a true urban society."
 unified_culture_jhn_title: "Unified Culture"
 unified_culture_jhn_desc: "We are a culturally divided nation, our ruling class and the western portion of the country are Japonic, belonging to the original culture of the Jin Kingdom, while our eastern province, containing the largest statelet, Saro, is Koreanic, belonging to later arrivals from the north. While the two cultures have coexisted peacefully thus far, in order to centralise our country we must pick one culture or the other as the official one."
 defensive_works_jhn_title: "Defensive Works"

Our one advantage is the plentiful resources that our land provides, especially iron. To secure our survival and, we hope, our eventual expansion into a larger power, we must make better use of these resources, and create an economy capable of supporting our future conquests."
 byeonhan_army_gay_title: "A Byeonhan Army"
 byeonhan_army_gay_desc: "Up until this point, we have relied on braves, who support us for fame, to protect their tribes, or because their elders have told them to come to us. This system will simply not do with the rapid changes in society, including rapid urbanisation and increased use of iron weapons and armour. It is vital that we create a conscript force, similar to the Chinese, and institute standard training and drill. Only by doing so, and increasing the number of soldiers available to us, can we hope to survive the coming centuries."
 yamato_allies_are_all_gay_title: "Yamato Allies"
 yamato_allies_are_all_gay_desc: "Jin and Yamato people were once one and the same. While we in Byeonhan have been influenced significantly by arrivals from the north, many old customs are still shared between us and the Yamato, and a portion of our population even still speaks the same language. By deepening the ties between ourselves and the Yamato, we reduce our reliance on the Chinese, and strengthen our position within Korea."

 diplomats_in_japan_have_turned_gay_desc: "While Yamato is a powerful nation, we should not rely on them exclusively. Diplomats visiting the Yamato have made us aware of many tribes such as the Kumaso, Hayato, and Thuchigumo, at least some of whom would make valuable allies and trading partners."

 warrior_king_i_am_a_mature_adult_gay_desc: "While many things are changing in Byeonhan, the expectation for leaders to be brave warriors has not. In order to replace our loose confederation with a kingdom, we must have a king respected for standing with his men in battle, for the men of Jin won’t bleed for a man who won’t bleed for them."
 military_advisors_gay_title: "Military Advisors"
 military_advisors_gay_desc: "The fall of Joseon came as a surprise to all of the Samhan, showing the extent of Han military superiority over their Korean counterparts. As the furthest kingdom from the Chinese in the north, we have also been the last to receive many of the innovations brought by the Chinese. This must change. We should seek out skilled men from the north, able to reform our military and society."
 iron_trade_so_gay_title: "Iron Trade"
 iron_trade_so_gay_desc: "Our territory is extremely rich in iron, to the extent of iron ingots being used as a form of currency in international trade. We should encourage this trade, expanding our mines so that we can obtain more of the precious objects and technologies arriving from elsewhere."
 trade_fleet_gay_title: "Trade Fleet"
 trade_fleet_gay_desc: "For centuries we have supplied the Han commanderies to the north, Yamato Japan, and the rest of Korea with iron. The rise of wokou pirates, however, has complicated this trade, especially with Japan.

 bringer_civilisation_mhn_desc: "Baekje would be among the leading nations responsible for spreading continental culture in Japan.

 reformation_mhn_title: "Reformation"
 reformation_mhn_desc: "The reopening of international trade with the conquest of Wiman Joseon by the Han has brought many significant changes to our society. From a loose confederation of fifty four different statelets of up to ten thousand families each, we have become a more traditional kingdom divided between just two power centres"
 phoenicia_east_mhn_title: "Phoenicia of the East"
 phoenicia_east_mhn_desc: "Historians would come to call Baekje, a member of our confederation, the Phoenicia of East Asia due to its naval prowess. The Mahan coast is long, with many good places for docks and shipyards. So far, however, our naval power is underwhelming. We should make use of our geography and build a true fleet, able to promote our interests along all the points of the compass, and in both Japan and China."
 naval_advisors_mhn_title: "Naval Advisors"
 naval_advisors_mhn_desc: "Our new fleet is the pride of our nation, but with few experienced sailors and no admirals, it will take considerable investment to convert ships into a true fighting force to project power overseas. To speed the development of the navy, we should seek out experienced naval men, perhaps from China or Japan, who can reform the force."
 animal_husbandry_mhn_title: "Animal Husbandry"
 animal_husbandry_mhn_desc: "The Sanguo Zhi records that our people have plentiful horses and oxen, but that we do not know how to ride them and that we make use of them only to accompany the dead. We should make efforts to change this by importing larger and stronger horses from the Xianbei in the north and breeding them here for our armies. By breeding only the best oxen generation after generation, we can also greatly increase the productivity of our fields, securing ever larger harvests able to feed ever greater numbers of people."
 subjugate_baekje_mhn_title: "Subjugate Baekje"
 subjugate_baekje_mhn_desc: "The rivalry between Baekje and Mokji for rulership of the Mahan Confederacy dates back almost to the founding of Baekje in 18 BC. In order for us to properly centralise Mahan, Baekje must be brought to heel, for as long they maintain independence the rivalry will continue to plague Mahan, while their strength is such that, if they’re humbled, all the other statelets will submit freely."
 riches_of_mahan_mhn_title: "Riches of Mahan"
 riches_of_mahan_mhn_desc: "Our confederation is the largest among the Samhan, our splendour is the greatest, our kings are the best known and most respected, our armies are the most formidable, and our people are the wealthiest and best connected to the Han in the north. We must make use of our nation’s many advantages to build up a treasury able to fund our efforts at home and abroad, thus ensuring that we not only remain the strongest of the Samhan, but that our power continues to grow."
 border_forts_mhn_title: "Border Forts"
 border_forts_mhn_desc: "The Mahan border is extremely long, with few major geographical features to provide protection, and with enemies on all sides.

 king_jun_mhn_desc: "King Jun of Gojoseon was overthrown by Wiman, a military leader from the former kingdom of Yan, which was conquered by the Han. While Wiman’s kingdom has itself been overthrown, and the area conquered by Han, the Chinese presence in the kingdom once ruled by one of our kings is a sore spot for the nation."
 restore_jin_jin_title: "Restore Jin"
 restore_jin_jin_desc: "The former Confederation of Jin collapsed centuries ago, leaving behind the confederacies of Mahan, Byeonhan, and Jinhan, each claiming to be its successor. With the Chinese pressing on Korea from the north, the collapse of Wiman Joseon, and rapid changes in society brought by the increase in foreign trade, it is time to reunite Jin under a single banner."
 dongyi_trade_jin_title: "Dongyi Trade"
 dongyi_trade_jin_desc: "Our state has grown strong on trade, but to truly secure our economy, we must utterly dominate the trade between Korea and Japan and prevent any other nation from replacing us the way that we’ve replaced many others. Only once our control of trade in our home region is complete can we hope to expand beyond it and create an empire where every commodity is found in abundance."
 beijing_trade_jin_title: "Beijing Trade"
 beijing_trade_jin_desc: "With our grasp over trade at home secure, we should expand into northern China, squeezing our adversaries out of their own home and ensuring that the trade goods that our people have craved for so long can reach our core lands safely. Through economic control of both sides of the Yellow Sea, all the waters around Korea will become our lake, and safe from any would-be attackers."
 hangzhou_trade_jin_title: "Hangzhou Trade"
 hangzhou_trade_jin_desc: "The Han Dynasty has been dealt a great blow, but they took all of China from a far worse position during the Chu-Han contention. We should not sit idle, for our state will only be truly secure when we’ve throttled the Han heartland and brought the whole thing entirely under our own control."
 tibet_jin_title: "Tibet"
 tibet_jin_desc: "The aggressive Tibetan states were a constant thorn in the side of the Han Dynasty, raiding Gansu, the Sichuan Basin, and many other parts of China from their untouchable mountain home. With the collapse of the Han, this is a problem that we’ve inherited, and one that we ought to bring a decisive end to through the conquest of Tibet, bringing the whole region under our banner."
 canton_trade_jin_title: "Canton Trade"
 canton_trade_jin_desc: "Southern China is an extremely populous and wealthy region, and up to this point it has resisted complete control. With our hold on the rest of China secure, we should make a renewed effort to increase our control over the regional economy and hence complete our economic and political conquest of China."
 iron_fist_jin_title: "Iron Fist of Korea"
 iron_fist_jin_desc: "The iron mines of Jin built our state, and while we have grown and changed a great deal since that time, iron remains vital to us, allowing us to make everything from tools to weapons and armour. With an empire like none other in history, our demand for iron has only grown, and to truly supply our state we’ll require every mine we can get our hands on."
 han_vs_han_jin_title: "Han Against Han"
 han_vs_han_jin_desc: "With the Samhan united once more we should turn our attention to the Chinese in the north of the country. With the fall of Wiman Joseon, the Han set up four Commanderies on its former territory; Lelang, Lintun, Xuantu, and Zhenfan. We should conquer all of them, justifying our expansion as a restoration of Gojoseon under the rule of the many Gojoseon refugees that fled to our lands."
 buyeo_jin_title: "Buyeo Kingdom"
 buyeo_jin_desc: "The last great Korean kingdom still defending its independence from us, historically Buyeo would fall in 504 under pressure from Baekje and the Xianbei. Buyeo has become a valuable ally for the Chinese as a buffer state against the Xianbei, and their continued independence prevents our nation from expanding further into the mainland. When they fall, however, we shall have formed a true kingdom of the Dongyi, united under a single banner."
 mighty_kingdom_jin_title: "Mighty Kingdom"
 mighty_kingdom_jin_desc: "It is not enough to unite Korea, we must build the greatest cities that the country has ever seen and expand well beyond the peninsula itself. Where Jin was an insignificant, peripheral nation on the very edge of the Sinosphere, it shall be transformed into the heart of a vast and cosmopolitan empire. The great obstacle in the way of this goal is the Han Dynasty to our west, an adversary that we cannot yet hope to defeat."
 ling_han_ling_jin_jin_title: "Ling Han, Ling Jin"
 ling_han_ling_jin_jin_desc: "Historically, the Han Dynasty collapsed and was replaced by the Jin Dynasty. Our own people are called both Han and Jin, despite our very different origins.

We find ourselves in a similar position as our conquered enemies, the Emishi especially, have built up settlements on Hokkaido. The Ainu possess little besides fish and furs, but they’ve been adept at bringing us into their own conflicts as we generally support them against the Emishi newcomers. This involvement, and the frequent raids by Emishi on northern Honshu, are quickly becoming more expensive than full occupation would be, and so we should launch a campaign to take the whole island."

Syrian mercenaries often times joined forces with Roman armies and fought against the Persians with their Mashriqi mercenaries. When Islam spread through the region, a message of open borders was spread which helped unify the conquering Caliphate. Now, however, this message is slowly being forgotten. Several Muslim tribes were not pleased by Ali being appointed as Caliph, most powerful of these tribes being the Umayyads. Mu'awiya, head of the Umayyads, had never been too fond of Ali, but after two of his loyal tribesmen, Talhah and Al-Zubayr were killed during the Battle of the Camel, he wished for revenge. The Syrian Muslims went on to murder 4000 suspected seditionists. Soon enough, Mu'awiya Umayyad revolted and wanted to not only seek the revenge that was properly due, but also conquer the Caliphate for himself. This started the first fitna, the first major civil war within the Islamic world."

The conflict culminated in the Battle of Karbala where Husayn and 71 of his followers were defeated and killed by 30,000 Umayyad soldiers. Becuase of this, the schism between Sunni and Shia was deepened as the Shia considered Husayn ibn Ali a martyr.

 dynasties.9.d: "The Abbasids were Arabs that descended from the youngest uncle of Muhammad, Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib. They viewed the Umayyads as illegitimate usurpers of the Islamic Caliphate. During the Umayyad Caliphate, the empire grew tremendously along with Islam. There were, however, many growing pains that came along with it. For starters, large parts of the Caliphate rejected Islam and stayed true to their original religion. These groups of people were often marginalized and looked down upon. Worse yet, non-arab muslims were treated the same way. Furthermore, Arab Muslims that lived outside the Arabian peninsula, such as settlers and soldiers, often felt displeased with the Caliphate for largly ignoring them. This caused massive unrest within the Umayyad Caliphate and a large number of people began to back the Abbasids as the true Caliphs of Islam. Now, Abu al-Abbas as-Saffah has begun the Abbasid Revolution, aiming to bring him and his family to power."

After being appointed governer of Syria and Egypt by the Umayyads, he continued to grow in power.

Across the next few centuries, the Abbasid Caliphate would make room for Islam's Golden Age, developing literature, math, and science greatly. Baghdad would become the center of the world and continue to be a marvel of its time until the sacking of it by the Mongols in the mid 13th century.

In the 9th century, the Qur'an was first translated into Persian converting much of the masses. Unfortunately, this also lead to their downfall as the Turks were converted to Islam and soon created their own rival dynasty, the Ghaznavids, who would eventually conquer the Samanid Empire.

They later became governers of Baghdad and kept the position from 820 to 891. The dynasty ended after Tahir's son, Muhammad ibn Tahir proved to be extremely incompetent in governence. Eventually, the people revolted, allowing the Saffarids to come in and take the majority of the territory.

Ruling from 1121 to 1269, the Almohads managed to withstand incursions from Christians in Iberia and continued to expand across Tunisia and Libya. In 1212, however, the Almohad Caliphate lost the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, essentially ending their rule in Iberia. By 1248, nearly all the possesions of the Almohads would be taken in Iberia. At the same time, The Almohads suffered from rebellions in North Africa, each taking small pieces away from the Caliphate. This paved way for the Marinids to rebel in 1215 and conquer nearly all of the lands of the Almohad Dynasty. The Last Almohad ruler died in 1269, being murdered by a slave in Marrakesh."

The Abbasids did not approve of the religious rebellion and thus removed the missionaries. This, however, did not stop the independence movement as two more insurrections, in 761 and 768, occured, but with little success. Finally, in 777 Abd ar-Rahmān ibn Rustam, who was one of the four original missionaries, was elected Imam. Unlike other Ibadi Imamets, this Imamete was hereditary. The justification was that Abd ar-Rahmān ibn Rustam came from no tribe, being of Persian descent, and thus would show no biase towards any of the Berber tribes in the area. From there, the Rustamids controlled the area around Tlemcen until 909 when they were defeated by the newly formid Fatimid Caliphate."

Although there is no concrete absolute certainty about their roles and duties in society, there are several sources that point to similar features of this group. The druids were one of the two most important social classes in Celtic society, the other being nobles, and were responsible for organizing worship, sacrifices, divination, and judicial procedures. They were exempt from military service and taxes and had the power to excommunicate anyone from social festivals and such. Pomponius Mela claimes that druids carried out their rituals in secret caves and trained by memorizing hundreds of verses by heart. Caeser remarked that such training could take up to twenty years to complete. All the verses were transmitted orally, and thus not a singe one has survived to the present day."

This ritual has helped shape the image of the druid in popular imagination as white-clad wise men performing sacrifices in forests."

The gods worshipped at Petra were notably Dushara and al-‘Uzzá. The Nabataeans used to represent their gods as featureless pillars or blocks. Their most common monuments to the gods, commonly known as 'god blocks', involved cutting away the whole top of a hill or cliff face so as to leave only a block behind. However, the Nabataeans became so influenced by other cultures such as those of Greece and Rome that their gods eventually became anthropomorphic and were represented with human features."

From the Angra Mainyu, all evils originate including Aži Dahāka, a monster with three mouths, six eyes, and three heads that encompasses all posible sins and evil counsels.

 zoroastrianism_flavor.3.d: "Originiating in 3rd or 4th century BC, Zurvanism grew exponentially in influence during the Sassanid Empire (224 - 651 CE). Zurvanism was a branch of Zoroastrianism that claimed that Zurvan, God of space and time, was the original first principle and not Ahura Mazda. It was Zurvan who made the equal-but-opposite twins Ahura Mazda (who later made Amesha Spenta) and Angra Mainyu. Zurvan was perceived to be a god of infinite space and time who was neutral and without passion. To him, there was no distinction between good and evil. The cult continued to grow until the collapse of the Sassanid Empire in the 7th century. It was quickly supplanted by Islam and the remaining Zurvanism followers either converted to Islam or to orthodox Zoroastrianism. By the 10th century, Zurvanism was extinct."

The Yasna contains the five Gathas which contain 17 hymns written by Zoroaster himself. Likewise, the Vendidad, which is the ecclesiastical code, and the Visperad, the collection of rituals, are both contained within the Avesta. Later editions of the Avesta had lesser texts inculding the Nyayesh texts, the Gah texts, the Yashts, the Siroza, and other small fragments that were called the Khordeh Avesta, or 'little Avesta'. The original master manuscript of the Avesta was published during the Sassanid Empire (224 - 651CE), but was eventually lost. Fragments from 9th and 10th century scriptures suggest that the original Avesta was four times larger than the fragments that remain in the present day."

The following king, Hormizd I, patronized Mani as well, but the following ruler, Bahram, eventualy put the supposed prophet to death. Although this was meant to deter the religion, followers of Manichaeism saw Mani's death as similar to the crucifixion of Christ and thus praised Mani for his martyrdom.

The average Tibetan house would have a number of houses or seats for the male god that protects the house. Everyday the man of the house would invoke this god and burn juniper wood and leaves to placate him. In addition the woman of the house would also have a protecting deity whose seat could be found within the kitchen usually at the top of the pole that supported the roof.

There Hwanung tought humans many things about art, medicine, and agriculture including acupuncture and moxibustion. When Dagun ascended the throne, he founded the walled city of Asadal located near Pyongyang. With this, the Gojoseon Kingdom was founded and would last for over two centuries, until the fall of Wanggeom in 108BC.

Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten and his capital to the newly created Akhetaten. Atenism believed that the sun-disk God Aten was the giver of all life, and through him all things are connected. Unfortunately, this heresy did not last long as after Akhenaten's death, the religion faded away and the court moved to another city.

People of all classes, including the king, asked questions of oracles, and, especially in the late New Kingdom their answers could be used to settle legal disputes or inform royal decisions. The most common means of consulting an oracle was to pose a question to the divine image while it was being carried in a festival procession, and interpret an answer from the barque's movements. Other methods included interpreting the behavior of cult animals, drawing lots, or consulting statues through which a priest apparently spoke.

 minting_of_separate_coins: "Separate Coin Minting"
 minting_of_separate_coins_desc: "The Sassanid Empire gave us many permissions as governors of Bactria and part of these permissions is the ability to mint our own coins. With this, the taxation system also falls more in line with our own ruluers as opposed to the Sassanid rulers, making our job easier and more streamlined. Kushano-Sassanian coins simply make our taxation system more distinct and our authority more firm in what land we hold."

Routinely we are under threat from these tribes as they seek both plunder and land from people to their south, but we must not let this continue on.

If the Kalabhras are to survive into the future, the borders will need to be secured and our enemies will need to be kept at bay."
 secure_our_subjects: "Secure the Kalabhra State"
 secure_our_subjects_desc: "There are many small subject states around the Kalabhras that need to be successfully integrated into our state over time, lest we wish them to become sources of rebellion in the future. The influences of the previous three powers are still strong enough in some areas that they can spark tension in local communities that slowly evolves into a stronger and more serious revolt in our own territory. Integration and assimilation efforts must and will continue to be a strong focus for us well into the future."

The Tamil people may be attached to their previous dynastic lineages and local leaders, but the Kalabhras need to promote a higher idea or ideal to the Tamil people over time. Uniting them into one cohesive state has been a goal of several leaders in the past and once they are, the Tamil people will be a truly grand force to be reckoned with on the entire subcontinent."

 kalabhra_administration_desc: "The administration of the Kalabhras is a source of contention for some but also a source of prosperity and opportunity for many others.

We have smaller cities and villages that provide men and taxes as well as a suitable defensive position when needed, but they are also situated in a much harsher terrain with denser forests and marshes crowding the path to get to them."

 promote_internal_leadership_desc: "What helped lead to our defeat was the intrusion of the Obodrites from the northwest. They attempted to intervene in our political struggles and ultimately help break the old federation down enough for the Christians to invade successfully. Let us learn from this time and firmly situate our politics inside the Lutici Federation once and for all; internal leadership is the way to stability and success, rather than relying on foreign armies for aid in securing power."

 the_destruction_of_bishoprics_desc: "If there is one thing that symbolizes the Christian encroachment into Lutici lands, it is the setting up of bishoprics to help convert the population of locals. The Great Slave Rising destroyed the likes of the Bishoprics of Brandenburg and Havelburg, signifying our defiance of Christian authority and conversion efforts. Thus, when we invade more Christian land, we will destroy even more bishoprics and de-convert the lands the Christians think they own with impunity."

We must patronize and promote Kannada literature when possible no matter if they are Hindu, Jain, or Buddhist in their faith."

Even women in Hoysala society are being seen moving throughout the society and learning various arts and being involved in administrative matters.

 aqu_restore_ancient_glory_desc: "During the times of the Romans, Aquileia was amongst the most important and grandiose cities in the Empire. As a result to its strategic location and proximity to the uncontrolled lands to the North and East, it was heavily developed and fortified. Home to an imperial palace amongst the residents of the city was the Emperor Diocletian. The rise of Christianity in the Empire brought Aquileia to new heights, chosen to be the site of various Councils of Aquileia. The fall of the Empire reduced Aquileia’s strategic importance, and power, however, and the various barbaric invasions wrecked havoc on the city. Pillaged over the centuries, and rocked by Magyar raids, Aquileia lies as a mare shadow of its former self, waiting to be rebuilt and restored."

Despite the Synod of Mantua granting the patriarch papal recognition, power struggles from within would diminish the position’s powers. Now, following the sack and destruction of Grado in 1027 and 1044, it is time for us to consolidate the powers unrightfully stolen by the nobility."

This allowed Aquileia to become a ecclesiastical member of the mighty Holy Roman Empire, and the Patriarch was grated comital rights and the status of Prince-Bishop.  Imperial recognition was also given and recognized nominal Aquileiesi control over Istria and Carinola. This move ushers in a new era for Aquileia."

Such a unique governing system and laws shall allow for a flourishing and effective governing."

Our neighboring territories such as Istria and Treviso, previously part of the old Patriarchate in its heyday have gradually been acquired by our rival. In order to have a chance of regaining our lost territory, we must directly confront them, else without our resistance they will be picked on one by one and be gone from our reach."

 aqu_avoid_domini_di_terraferma_desc: "We have seen Venice, once a mere lagoon to our south, evolve to becoming a trade entrepôt supported by a mighty navy, perhaps the most powerful in the entire Mediterranean world. The power of Venice must be dealt with and curtailed, as the city can only be a threat to our mere independence.

Despite this, the integrity of the empire is far from secured.

 string_start_hnd_58: "The Han Dynasty has been the dominant force in asia, and controller of China proper for over 200 years. By now, many have attempted to topple it with the latest attempt being by Wang Mang, who proclaimed himself emperor of the Xin Dynasty in 9CE. However, his rule was short, as in 23CE a rebellion broke out and restored the Han Dynasty. The next few years saw some political instability, but the empire is now in a steady process of recovery. The borders of the empire are also mostly secure, as the biggest threat, the nomadic Xiongnu to the north, recently suffered from a civil war of their own greatly decreasing their strength. The empire is safe for the time being, however internal instability could always return to become a problem."
 string_start_igr_58: "We are the last. Over three centuries ago, our ancestors strode triumphantly across the vast, smoldering remnants of the once unbeatable Persian Empire. Under the leadership of Alexander, the greatest leader in history, it seemed Greek culture, Greek learning, and Greek civilization would rule the entire world, from the fertile lands of Europe to the deserts of Asia. We were wrong. The Empire collapsed into warring states, the strongest being the tyrannical Seleucids, who our Bactrian ancestors revolted against. Our current state was founded by the general Apollodotus, when he refused to let the Indian provinces take part in the civil wars that would eventually lead to Bactria's destruction at the hands of steppe barbarians. Now, Bactria and the Seleucid Empire are ruled by new Kushan and Parthian regimes, whose lapdogs have occupied the vast majority of our country.\n\nAs the last free Greeks in the whole world, a difficult choice faces us. Once we push the Indo-Scythians and Kushans back across the Hindu Kush, should we continue west, attempting to restore Alexander's empire and eventually liberating our lost homeland from the distant Roman tyrants now ruling it? Or should we accept that we are now Indian, and try to build a new home and power for ourselves in Asia? Either way we must act fast to occupy weak nearby states to gain a chance against the enemy hordes."

As his realm is finally ruled by a true Persian, it enters its best period in history, a golden age of Persia.\nYet, the rivals are still there. The Roman Empire to the west is still a big, civilized threat. The Empire of Kushan to the east is also a worthy, powerful rival. There are many opportunities, though. Will the new, reborn Sassanid Persia rise to the glory never seen since the days of the Achaemenid Empire, or succumb to the internal strife that is still going on after the defeat of former Parthian rulers?"

 string_start_srr_637: "While most of the Avar kin left their homeland to claim the steppes and the glory of pillaging their enemies, some of them stayed. They settled down and founded a kingdom of Sarir, and they got christianized, unlike their Tengrist steppe brothers. \nWith a new religion called Islam rising in the south, and expanding dangerously northwards, Kotrag might be forced to look for an alliance to secure the existence of his state, and fend off the Muslim invaders when the time comes."
 string_start_tib_637: "Tibet's situation in this period of time is one of great opportunity, yet also one of great danger. The flourishing Tang Dynasty of China casts a shadow over this Buddhist kingdom, as Tibet is constantly under threat of invasion by Chinese forces. \nIn the south, the broken up Himalayan Duchies and Kingdoms are low-hanging fruits for the kingdom, but doing so will cause a bigger frontline with the Indian Hindu Kingdoms.\nTo the East lies Several Hindu and Muslim Emirates and Kingdoms, and after that, the Sassanid Empire. To provoke the Eagle of Zoroastrianism would certainly be a death wish, as the armies of Persia would be strong enough to crush any armies you have.\nTo the north lies various Buddhist kingdoms, as well as the remains of the Gokturk Khaganate. In the northwest however, the Western Gokturks are equally matched if you manage to get a border with them."
 string_start_baltic_637: "The Baltic-speaking peoples on the eastern coast of the Baltic sea, otherwise self-labeled as the Aistians, are known for being a culturally isolated group with distant ancestral relationship with the Slavs. Despite being autonomous of each other, the numerous tribes would unite against invaders under a single name representing their individual nation, in a sense that they still established loose confederacies\n.The Balts have a long history of continuous raids on neighboring Slavic and Finnic peoples, and they have intensified as the tribes consolidated over the centuries."
 string_start_eng_1066: "When Edward the Confessor died without an heir in 1066, it seemed that Harold Godwinson, a person whose family has been steadily gaining power in the realm over the past decade, would succeed the throne. However, it then became known that Edward promised the throne to not only Harold, but also to William II in Normandy, and also Harald Hardrada in Norway! The English throne is now being fought over. The people of England don't want to have to live, once again, under viking rule, not forgetting the dark memories of the North Sea Empire under Denmark only a few decades ago. However, even under the Normans, the Kingdom would still lose its independence. Uncertain and dark times are ahead for the Anglo-Saxon people. Can Harold Godwinson successfully defend his home country from the vikings and conquerors? Or will he, his dynasty, culture, and country be lost and forgotten in time, like the now distant memory of the Roman Empire? The question is for you to decide."
 string_start_gal_1066: "Galicia has regained its independence on the head of King García II. In 1066, the Iberian struggle known as the Reconquista seems to be at an impasse after the death of king Fernando I of León, the Great. Today, the greatest threat to the multiple Christian and Muslim realms are not the unfaithful, but their coreligionist neighbors.\nGarcía is the youngest of the 3 male heirs of Fernando the Great. His elder siblings are the kings Sancho of Castille and Alfonso of León. Sancho being the eldest considers the three kingdoms his birthright, he is the more military capable sibling and Castille has the strongest army. Alfonso is highly intelligent and scheming, and has the loyalty of Garcia's most powerful vassals, the count of Portugal Nuno Mendes and the Vizier of Coímbra Sisnando Davides. However at the south, the Muslim emirates are starting to coalesce into a few, strong kingdoms, and will soon pose a threat to the warring heirs of Fernando. And further south, beyond the Columns of Hercules, the Almoravid dynasty of Morocco has set its sights in Iberia.\nAt this crossroads, Garcia II needs to secure the position of Galicia"
 string_start_nca_1206: "We have survived the fall of Constantinople and the the partition of the Empire by the Latin army. We have stabilized and have adapted.\nNow is time to press our claim to the imperial throne, but we are not alone. The pretenders in Trebizond will have to be destroyed before we can reclaim the 'City Of World's Desire' and restore the Byzantine Empire to it's former glory!\nIt is time to gather our armies and reclaim the 'City Of World's Desire' and restore the Holy Patriarch of Constantinople in the name of the Orthodox faith!"
 string_start_bri_1241: "The Duke, Jean Ier de Dreux, descendent of King Louis VI is a good ally of the King of France, Louis IX. But on the coasts, the English spread their influence in Brittany, and the continental French divide us from the Empire.\n\nWill we ensure our independancy, hardly saved from immemorial times, will we unite the Celtic people under a common banner? Or shall we know the same fate that so many other duchies and small kingdoms before us."
 string_start_mal_1241: "In the 12th century, the Empire of Mali is in a unique position within West Africa. Her position between the vast goldfields in the Volta river valleys to the south and the lucrative salt mines in the northern sections of her borders had made Mali one of the premier economic forces on the planet at the time. The previous ruler, the great Mansa Musa, had expanded Malian territory to include gold mines on the Niger and Senegal Rivers, and the vital river trading posts of Timbuktu and Gao. The surge to Mali’s income allowed her to field a capable full-time army and provide security for the thousands of traders coming from Adalusia, Eastern Africa, and the Middle East. Musa’s passing has left the country in the unsure hands of his son, Maghan Keita, yet to be tested as a leader. With threats to trade and territorial boundaries from neighboring kingdoms, notably the Songhai, and a long standing feud with the Berbers of North Africa, only time will tell if Maghan can continue to expand his father’s imperial legacy or if he will oversee Mali’s fall from grace."
 string_start_ser_1337: "With help of influential nobles and clergy in 1331 Stefan Dusan was crowned king of Serbia and has expanded Serbia significantly in a short amount of time. However, our position is not yet completly secure. Byzantium is weakened, but they are atill a danger to Serbia. Hungary has claimed our northern lands and war is likely to escalate. Ottomans are becoming stronger and are probably becoming a major rival in the Balkans in the near future."
 string_start_ser_1836: "In 1817 Serbia became an autonomous principality within the Ottoman Empire. With power frequently changing between two competing dynasties, they couldn't make any significant reforms in the short time they ruled. To the north of us, the hostile Habsburg monarchy holds our core lands in Vojvodina. Serbia's overlord, and the only other neighbour, Ottomans, are powerful but not invincible. With smart diplomatic play and stronger military they could be beaten."
 string_start_tex_1836: "The government of New Spain faced serious problems from Comanche raids in their territory of Tejas, and so an agreement was made with the USA that would allow limited settlement of Texas by American settlers, provided that these meet a number of criteria, including the conversion to Roman Catholicism and the freedom of any slaves brought into the territory. This agreement was later affirmed by Mexico, however many of the Americans did not accept the conditions placed upon them.\n\nIn 1825 a census of Austin's Colony showed 1347 Anglo-Americans and 443 people of African descent, almost all slaves. The settlers meanwhile complained that New Spain and later Mexico did not protect American settlers, and thus the settlers didn't need to meet the conditions imposed upon them. On 16th December 1826, Haden Edwards, his brothers, and thirty American settlers declared independence as the Republic of Fredonia, but were ultimately quashed.\n\nOn 19th December 1832 a proclamation was issued to the Mexican Congress complaining of a lack of protection from natives; poor pay for militias; insufficient local and legislative representation; forbidding of further immigration from the USA; lack of funding for schools; and violations of the Constitution of 1824. Some attempts were made to address concerns by the settlers in 1833 but it was too little and too late.\n\nTexas has declared independence, and driven out the Mexican army, yet the USA, afraid to antagonise Mexico, or tip the balance of power in favour of the slave states, is yet to recognise Texas as a new state of the union. Trapped between powerful neighbours, Texas must make a choice, to continue to seek American recognition as a state; to return to Mexico and seek to address its grievances within the legal system amid increasingly hostile race relations; or to carve its own path, independent from both the USA and Mexico."
 string_start_usa_1836: "Independent for less than a century, the United States seeks to expand her borders to contend with European Powers. With the war of 1812 a recent but fading memory, some still fear the English. \nWith Mexico at her border, and Texas ripe for the taking with her growing desire for independence, the US may yet stretch from sea to shining sea, whether her neighbors like it or not"
 string_start_fra_1836: "France at the time is a major European power located in Western Europe, controlling a part of the coast of Algeria. France is led by a man known as Louis Phillppe under a Liberal controlled Consituitional Monarchy, starting after a revolution in the month of July in 1830.\nFrance is currently in two wars, one in a colonial conquest of Algeria that started in 1830, and the other is against Netherlands after Belgium revolted in 1830, supporting Belgium to keep a balance of power in Europe (also supported by Britain) between Prussia and France.\nOnly 20 years ago France had been the main millitary power on the contitent, maybe it will come back?"
 string_start_usa_1861: "The U.S. was engulfed in a bitter conflict over slavery ever since its founding, but the invention of cotton gin that precipitated slavery in the south combined with the urbanization of the north polarized the two regions. The two disagreed over a number of political issues, such as national railroads, tariffs, homesteads, and above all, the expansion of slavery to the western territories. The tension came to a head when Republican Presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln was elected with just 39% of the popular vote, not even appearing on the ballot in many southern states. Though he swore he had no intention of abolishing slavery in the southern states, the antebellum South pulled out of the U.S., believing secession was the only path to protecting the southern way of life.\n\nThe Union must put down the 'southern rebellion' to keep the country together, while preventing European powers from aiding the Confederates and forever dividing America in two."
 string_start_csa_1861: "The fire-eaters have pushed eleven former U.S. slave-states over the edge, convincing their state legislatures to back out of the United States and form the Confederate States of America. The war is a result of many factors, particularly the regional and sectional differences of the two parts of the U.S., but secession from the Union was begot primarily from a fear of the abolition of slavery.\n\nTo achieve independence and the formation of a slave empire, the Confederacy must fight a long defensive war against the militarily and technologically advanced North, while simultaneously preventing our own union of states from splintering apart from within.\n\nEven if we succeed, the Americas will be greatly weakened as a result of a divided great power, but if we fail, the traditional lifestyle of the southern U.S. will be lost forever."
 string_start_ser_1914: "After the murder of Aleksandar Obrenovic in 1903, the parliament appointed a new king, Aleksandar Karadjordjevic.  After 500 years of occupation Serbia is now completly independent, but Ottomans and Austrians still hold a lot of Serbian core lands. The idea that all southern Slavs should be united under one nation is becoming popular amongst the people. The constitution of 1888 has been restored and Serbia is now a young constitutional monarchy. Force might be necessary to drive off Turks and Austrians from Balkan. Surrounded by enemies and poverty, can Serbia keep its recently gained independence?"
 string_start_ger_1939: "After a disastrous defeat in WW1, Germany was crippled militarily, diplomatically, and economically. Billions in war reparations coupled with hyperinflation resulted in a severe economic depression. Desperate for change, the German people turned to a new party, the National Socialists, and its leader, Adolf Hitler, to turn things around. After seizing power and reforming Germany into a fascist dictatorship, Adolf Hitler began an aggressive campaign to turn his nation into a global empire spanning all of Europe and beyond, and used eugenics to assert that the people of Germany were ethnic Aryans, a supposed 'master race', and slowly began the mass genocide of Jews across Europe. Hitler annexed both Czechoslovakia and Austria, and the rest of the world finally drew the line at the German invasion of Poland, with Great Britain and France being the first to declare war as the second global conflict in just 20 years began.\n\nCan Germany succeed in forming the next global empire? Or will WW2 result in a defeat even worse than WW1?"
 string_start_sov_1947: "A new era for Soviet Russia has emerged. After the conclusion of WWII, the Soviets has reigned over all of Eastern Europe. They have defeated the fascists, and now, the democratic countries of the Western world challenge them. In the wake of this ideological conflict, relations have worsened, forming a rivalry between two very different ideologies. However, one question remains"
 string_start_ger_1947: "A age of division has dawned upon Germany. After being humiliated after the defeat of two world wars, Germany has been split in two. With capitalism in the west and communism in the east, they have both been subjugated by superpowers. With the country now split in two by the iron curtain and the two halves stuck on opposing sides of a new cold war, reunification seems impossible. But, if the impossible were to happen, which system would Germany unite under? Capitalism or communism?"
 string_start_usa_1947: "A new age has emerged on America and the Western World. Ever since the collapse of the Third Reich and the end of WW2 in 1945, the world has been dominated by two ideologies"
 string_start_ger_1991: "The stage is set for prosperity in Germany. After the fall of German Democratic Republic and the reunification of Germany, Germany has been in complete economic, political, and domestic peace, unseen for nearly a century. Germany now has the chance to retake prosperity not held for a very long time, if only it can make the peace last. To ensure lasting peace in Europe, perhaps increased co-operation between the major powers of Europe could be in order."
 string_start_hab_present: "Once a big Empire and a major world player but today a small country in the shadow of his big brother Germany. Despite beeing a small country, Austria is still very important. Safely in the middle of the European Union this once great country can rise to power trough diplomacy again. Besides many in the world not knowing the difference between Austria and Australia Austria could be able to bring glory to this name again by unifying the European Union and rival the rising China and the world superpower USA."
 string_start_usa_present: "The modern era has seen the U.S. grow to be the greatest military and economic force in the world. Consumerism thrives and popular culture permeates every facet of life. However, the rise of terrorism following the 9/11 attacks and tensions in the Middle East has spawned a new world order rife with conflict, sectionalism, nationalism, and global catastrophes such as Climate Change and World Hunger. The U.S. must work with its allies to balance world power and maintain peace across the globe in the face of various crises."

 mil_tech_cs_1_desc: "The spear has been used for hunting since the dawn of man, so it should be effective in hunting men as well."
 mil_tech_cs_2_desc: "The bow allows to fight the enemy at a great distance, long before a melee opponent has a chance of fighting back."
 mil_tech_cs_3_desc: "Centuries ago horses were too small to ride on, but now these animals have become capable of carrying humans into combat."
 mil_tech_cs_4_desc: "In ancient times the chariot was the most fearsome unit on the battlefield. Now, however, they are becoming obsolete due to the incresed significance of cavalry."
 mil_tech_cs_5_desc: "Through the course of human history, commonplace objects have been pressed into service as weapons. Axes are no exception. Besides axes designed for combat, there were many axes that doubled as tools and weapons."
 mil_tech_cs_6_desc: "Early Iron Age swords were significantly different from later steel swords. They were work-hardened, rather than quench-hardened, which made them about the same or only slightly better in terms of strength and hardness to earlier bronze swords."
 mil_tech_cs_7_desc: "The earliest cavalrymen were often unarmored and armed with low quality weapons. As the role of cavalry in the battlefield increased, they recieved better equipment and light armor."
 mil_tech_cs_8_desc: "The Parthian shot was a military tactic made famous by the Parthians. The Parthian archers mounted on light horse, while retreating at a full gallop, would turn their bodies back to shoot at the pursuing enemy."
 mil_tech_cs_9_desc: "A standing army is a permanent, often professional, army. It is composed of full-time soldiers and is not disbanded during times of peace."
 mil_tech_cs_10_desc: "A war elephant was an elephant trained and guided by humans for combat. Their main use was to charge the enemy, trampling them and breaking their ranks and instilling terror."
 mil_tech_cs_11_desc: "Without any armor, the large horses are easy targets for the enemy. By providing the horses with armor, the cavalry would survive better on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_cs_12_desc: "Raiding is a military tactic that is not normally intended to capture and hold terrain, but instead to rob and pillage enemy holdings and then to quickly retreat."
 mil_tech_cs_13_desc: "A composite bow is a bow made from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together. When the bow is drawn, the sinew and horn store more energy than wood for the same length of bow. The strength can be made similar to that of all-wood bows, with similar draw-length and therefore a similar amount of energy delivered to the arrow from a much shorter bow."
 mil_tech_cs_14_desc: "Scale armour is an early form of armour consisting of many individual small armour scales of various shapes attached to each other and to a backing of cloth or leather in overlapping rows."
 mil_tech_cs_15_desc: "A large group of horses charging full speed towards a defender is a scary sight and often even the most disciplined soldiers broke formation or fled."
 mil_tech_cs_16_desc: "Covering both the rider and the horse in scale armor did slow the cavalry down a bit, but made it also very hard to kill."
 mil_tech_cs_17_desc: "Constructing better fortifications is essential to slow down an advancing enemy or preventing our towns from being easily raided."
 mil_tech_cs_18_desc: "Even the mightiest army doesn't do well without a capable commander. With the right tactics it is possible to beat back a far superior foe."
 mil_tech_cs_19_desc: "A stirrup is a light frame or ring that holds the foot of a rider, attached to the saddle by a strap. Stirrups are used to aid in mounting and as a support while riding. They greatly increase the rider's ability to stay in the saddle and control the mount, increasing the animal's usefulness to humans in areas such as communication, transportation and warfare."
 mil_tech_cs_20_desc: "Providing all our troops with proper military training will increase their combat abilities as well as morale and discipline."
 mil_tech_cs_21_desc: "Ring armour was believed to be a leather or textile item of clothing with a large number of metal rings sewn or tied directly into the foundation garment. Unlike mail armour, the rings are not physically interlocked with each other."
 mil_tech_cs_22_desc: "Eventually smiths learned that by adding an amount of carbon to the iron, they could produce an improved alloy now known as steel. By quenching and tempering, swords could be made that would suffer much less damage, and would spring back into shape if bent."
 mil_tech_cs_23_desc: "The natives of large grassland areas developed mounted archery for hunting, and for war. In battle, light horse archers were typically skirmishers; lightly armed missile troops capable of moving swiftly to avoid close combat or to deliver a rapid blow to the flanks or rear of the foe."
 mil_tech_cs_24_desc: "Military organisation is the structuring of the armies of a state allowing better control, management and administration."
 mil_tech_cs_25_desc: "The lance is a pole weapon or spear designed to be used by a mounted warrior. During the periods of Classical and Medieval warfare it evolved into being the leading weapon in cavalry charges."
 mil_tech_cs_26_desc: "Camel cavalry were a common element in desert warfare throughout history due in part to the animal's high level of adaptability. They provided a mobile element better suited to work and survive in an arid and waterless environment than the horses of conventional cavalry."
 mil_tech_cs_27_desc: "Although tempering swords was invented earlier, it took a long time before this was done consistently, and even until the end of the early medieval period, many swords were still unhardened iron."
 mil_tech_cs_28_desc: "In ancient and medieval warfare, skirmishers typically carried bows, javelins, slings, and sometimes light shields. Acting as light infantry with their light arms and minimal armour, they could run ahead of the main battle line, release a volley of arrows, slingshots or javelins, and retreat behind their main battle line before the clash of the opposing main forces."
 mil_tech_cs_29_desc: "Originally, knights or nobles were mounted warriors who swore allegiance to their sovereign and promised to fight for him in exchange for an allocation of land."
 mil_tech_cs_30_desc: "A bodkin point is a type of arrowhead. In its simplest form it is an uncomplicated squared metal spike, and was used extensively during the Middle Ages. Its main purpose was to penetrate heavy plate armor."
 mil_tech_cs_31_desc: "Forming a royal guard would help in keeping the most important people alive and can also function as an elite armed force during times of war."
 mil_tech_cs_32_desc: "Chivalry, or the chivalric code, is the traditional code of conduct associated with the medieval institution of knighthood. Chivalry arose from an idealized German custom. It developed first in the north of France among horse soldiers who served in Charlemagne′s heavy cavalry."
 mil_tech_cs_33_desc: "In hit-and-run tactics the purpose of the combat involved is not to seize control of territory, but to inflict damage on a target and immediately exit the area to avoid the enemy's retaliation. It is meant to have a psychological effect on the enemy's morale."
 mil_tech_cs_34_desc: "The shield wall is a military tactic that was common in many cultures in the Pre-Early Modern warfare age. In general, a shield wall was formed by soldiers standing in formation shoulder to shoulder, holding their shields so that they abut or overlap."
 mil_tech_cs_35_desc: "A crossbow is a type of bow consisting of a horizontal limb assembly mounted on a stock that shoots projectiles, called bolts or quarrels. The crossbow was the first projectile weapon to be simple and physically-undemanding enough to be operated by large numbers of conscript soldiers, in contrast to traditional bows which required considerable strength and skill to use effectively."
 mil_tech_cs_36_desc: "On a sword, the crossguard is a bar of metal at right angles to the blade, placed between the blade and the hilt. Its purpose is to protect the swordsman's hands."
 mil_tech_cs_37_desc: "Holy warriors were often devout or fanatic religious soldiers that would display great courage and valor when fighting infidels."
 mil_tech_cs_38_desc: "A mace is a blunt weapon that uses a heavy head on the end of a handle to deliver powerful blows. During the Middle Ages metal armour and chain mail protected against the blows of edged weapons and blocked arrows and other projectiles. Solid metal maces proved able to inflict damage on well armoured knights, as the force of a blow from a mace can cause damage without penetrating the armour."
 mil_tech_cs_39_desc: "Several inventions like the saddle, the stirrup and the spur allowed the rider to have better control of the mount. In western Europe there emerged what is considered the ultimate heavy cavalry, the knight. The knights and other similarly equipped mounted men-at-arms charged in close formation, exchanging flexibility for a massive, irresistible first charge."
 mil_tech_cs_40_desc: "A longbow is a type of bow that is tall, roughly equal to the height of the person who uses it. In the Middle Ages the English and Welsh were famous for their very powerful Welsh longbows, used to great effect in the civil wars of the period and against the French in the Hundred Years' War."
 mil_tech_cs_41_desc: "A longsword is a type of European sword characterized as having a cruciform hilt with a grip for two-handed use and a straight double-edged blade."
 mil_tech_cs_42_desc: "A brigandine is a form of body armour from the Middle Ages. It is a cloth garment, generally canvas or leather, lined with small oblong steel plates riveted to the fabric."
 mil_tech_cs_43_desc: "A pike is a pole weapon, a very long thrusting spear formerly used extensively by infantry. The pike, due to its unwieldy nature, was always intended to be used in a deliberate, defensive manner, often in conjunction with other missile and melee weapons."
 mil_tech_cs_44_desc: "Plate armour is a historical type of personal armour made from iron or steel plates, culminating in the iconic suit of armour entirely encasing the wearer."
 mil_tech_cs_45_desc: "The most heavily armoured troops of the Middle Ages were heavy cavalry such as the gendarmes and early cuirassiers."
 mil_tech_cs_46_desc: "The creation of a professional military class is the first step to creation of a modern army."
 mil_tech_cs_47_desc: "Charging blindly at the enemy is perhaps not the greatest tactic known to man, but it is one of the simplest to master. It is also the stepping stone to more advanced strategies."
 mil_tech_cs_48_desc: "In 1500, during the siege of Pisa the walls started to crumble under the barrage of the French siege artillery. Local residents started to pile up the rumble outside, in form of a slopping rampart. This proved to be less vulnerable to artillery fire, while at the same time still able to resist an escalade."
 mil_tech_cs_49_desc: "Throughout the middle ages cavalry's dominance was being challenged by disciplined pikemen. In battles such as Bannockburn or the Golden Spurs, cavalry was defeated by pikes. A combination of improved training and discipline, and the addition of swordsmen to provide close combat support has raised this formation to the peak of its efficiency."
 mil_tech_cs_50_desc: "A pike is a remarkably simple weapon to make, but to get the full benefit from the use of pikes, it's required for the whole formation to be wielding weapons of similar length and blade."
 mil_tech_cs_51_desc: "Although hand cannons had been developed in China in the 12th century and had spread to Europe by the 14th, the weakness of these weapons reduced their battlefield utility. Light and reliable Arquebus was able to displace bow due to three main factors. It had better armor penetration, it was easier to train men to use it, and it did not rely on the strength of the user."
 mil_tech_cs_52_desc: "Artillery had been documented in Europe since the thirteenth century, but due to its lack of mobility, it had very limited battlefield use. The development of the Limber in the 1470s allowed guns to become more mobile and thus useful."
 mil_tech_cs_53_desc: "The Arquebus was easy to use as a weapon, but was also inaccurate and slow to fire, leaving its user vulnerable to cavalry charges. Blending with Pikemen allowed Arquebusiers to fire and then fall back to be shielded by Pikemen when enemy cavalry or infantry appeared."
 mil_tech_cs_54_desc: "The value of training and experience has always been great on the battlefield. With the advent of gunpowder and the tactical changes associated with it and other infantry weapons came a great demand for units versed in these new innovations. As professional armies were still far away this need had to be filled by mercenary units such as the Condottieri, Swiss Mercenaries or Landsknechte. A growing class of professional mercenary officers came to live of supplying these regiments to needing states in the middle of the military transition."
 mil_tech_cs_55_desc: "Pike and shot formations proved a major threat to medieval knights. The initial response was heavier armor to counter the power of gunpowder weapons, but this slowed down cavalry, reducing their shock power. Reiters were usually armed with two pistols and a sword, allowing them to either shoot or charge depending on the opposition they faced."
 mil_tech_cs_56_desc: "The Arquebus proved to be a very effective weapon for armor penetration, the result was that armor began to get heavier to resist its fire. A larger musket could deliver a heavier round offering better armor penetration "
 mil_tech_cs_57_desc: "Spanish Square developed naturally from the Pike and shot formations. At its core was a traditional Pike Square. At each of the corners it had a group of Arquebusiers. It kept the staying power of the traditional pike square and enhanced it with the firepower of the Arquebus."
 mil_tech_cs_58_desc: "The new and more mobile artillery had one problem - it could not be easily elevated up and down to adjust its firing range. Trunnions were cylindrical protrusions that acted as mounts for the gun on its carriage, which allowed it to be tilted and thus aimed better."
 mil_tech_cs_59_desc: "It was difficult to fire around curved walls, thus once attackers got close enough to the fortification, the ability of other parts of the defenses to provide flanking fire was nullified. The development of star-shaped bastions allowed every part of the wall to be supported from other parts."
 mil_tech_cs_60_desc: "The size and depth of the Spanish Square gave it staying power but made it slow and cumbersome to maneuver on the battlefield. It also led to a large percentage of troops being inactive during battles. Maurice of Nassau, the Stadtholder of the Netherlands, reduced the total number of men in the formation to make it more mobile and reduced its depth, so it maintained the same firepower and shock values."
 mil_tech_cs_61_desc: "With artillery's growing importance in the battlefield, also the number of firearms kept increasing. But because each gun was made separately, it also required great effort to resupply. In 1544, Emperor Charles V declared that there would be only 5 calibres of gun, while King Henry II of France set 6 standard calibres."
 mil_tech_cs_62_desc: "The matchlock firing mechanism's biggest weakness was the need to keep the match lit in order to fire the weapon. Although wheellock was developed, it was too expensive to produce to enter into mass use. The development of flintlock created a more reliable weapon."
 mil_tech_cs_63_desc: "The carbine was a shorter form of the musket."
 mil_tech_cs_64_desc: "Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, further developed infantry units to improve their firepower. His infantry formations were narrowed and made rectangular to increase the number of muskets that could fire in each volley. Attachment of small artillery pieces further increased the firepower of infantry."
 mil_tech_cs_65_desc: "With development of new bastions engineers began to improve the art of positioning them to channel attacking armies into specially prepared killing grounds, where the defenders could inflict maximum amount of casualties on their enemy."
 mil_tech_cs_66_desc: "Thanks to bayonets, each musketeer could function as a pikeman as well. This allowed pikes to be removed from infantry equipment and provided infantry formations with more firepower."
 mil_tech_cs_67_desc: "In the 1620s the idea of combining the shot and powder into a single unit, a cartridge, allowed for faster reloading and thus firing. This in turn dramatically improved the firepower of guns."
 mil_tech_cs_68_desc: "Heavily armored cavalrymen were by their nature cumbersome to form up and vulnerable on the battlefield. Lighter cavalry was added to armies to act as scouts for the army during marching and screen heavier cavalry before its charge on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_cs_69_desc: "An outer ditch became a key area for the siege. If attacking troops gained control of the glacis, then the bastions would be lost. The ditch became the first line of defense for a fort. Access to this ditch, and ensuring it kept providing protection to defending troops became a key part of fortification design."
 mil_tech_cs_70_desc: "Improvements in metallurgy allowed cannons to become lighter and more reliable. This allowed them to become more effective on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_cs_71_desc: "First introduced to the Austrian army as irregular troops from the military frontier during the Seven Years war, Light Infantry Companies were deployed in loose order and proved to be very effective at harassing enemy and leading assaults on entrenchments."
 mil_tech_cs_72_desc: "Although a musket could always be wielded as a club, it was not an effective hand-to-hand weapon. A bayonet was a blade that was fitted to the end of a musket, allowing the weapon to function as a spear. Initial bayonet designs plugged the barrel, making it an either or choice, but the development of the ring bayonet, which fitted around the barrel, turned a musket into a useful support weapon."
 mil_tech_cs_73_desc: "Although a cuirass (or a breast plate) had existed for many years, only recently a new style of cavalryman gained popularity, with only a breast and back plate, which provided better balance between protection to the key parts of the body and mobility."
 mil_tech_cs_74_desc: "Thanks to the building of several layers of fortification, overrunning of outer bastions simply moved the siege to the next layer, forcing attackers to prepare new locations to site guns and increasing the length of the siege."
 mil_tech_cs_75_desc: "The introduction of light infantry troops led to a change in warfare. Skirmishers were deployed forward in loose order to distract and harass the enemy before the main infantry attack, which was typically delivered in either a line or a column."
 mil_tech_cs_76_desc: "The musket's weakness was the fact that it was highly inaccurate beyond 50 yards. The rifle, although never a standard infantry weapon, added greater range to elite units, which gave the army a greater overall punch."
 mil_tech_cs_77_desc: "Originally developed for siege purposes, the howitzer fired a high angled projectile over the fortifications and into the town inside. The field howitzer, a lighter more mobile variant, would fire an explosive shell above enemy troops. Mixed with other artillery types, it added to the effectiveness of artillery brigades."
 mil_tech_cs_78_desc: "The percussion cap, introduced circa 1820, was the crucial invention that enabled muzzleloading firearms to fire reliably in any weather. The percussion cap replaced the flint, the steel 'frizzen', and the powder pan of the flint-lock mechanism."
 mil_tech_cs_79_desc: "Although breech-loading weapons were developed as far back as the late 14th century, breech-loading became more successful with improvements in precision engineering and machining in the 19th century. The main challenge for developers of breech-loading weapons was sealing the breech. This was eventually solved by the developments of the self-contained metallic cartridge and the interrupted screw."
 mil_tech_cs_80_desc: "A needle gun is a firearm that has a needle-like firing pin, which can pass through the paper cartridge case to strike a percussion cap at the bullet base. A needle gun with a barrel that has a rifling cut into the barrel walls is also called needle rifle."
 mil_tech_cs_81_desc: "The first bolt-action rifle was produced in 1824 following work on breechloading rifles that dated to the 18th century. European armies continued to develop bolt-action rifles through the late 19th century, adopting tubular magazines and later box magazines. The Mauser Gewehr 98 was considered the epitome of this type of action, and its descendents became the standard against which all such rifles are measured. World War I marked the height of the bolt-action rifle's use, with all of the nations in that war fielding troops armed with various bolt-action designs."
 mil_tech_cs_82_desc: "Developing a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism for artillery, could keep the gun's trail and wheels perfectly still during the firing sequence. Since the gun would not need to be re-aimed after each shot, the crew could fire as soon as the barrel returned to its resting position significantly increasing the rate of fire."
 mil_tech_cs_83_desc: "Some of our military engineers have come up with the idea of heavily armored tracked vehicles. These tanks could able to cross trenches, resist small-arms fire, travel over difficult terrain, carry supplies, and capture fortified enemy positions."
 mil_tech_cs_84_desc: "The recent invention of airplanes could be useful for military purposes. They could be used for reconnaissance or to drop bombs on enemy territory."
 mil_tech_cs_85_desc: "Although the tanks have proven to be useful in the battlefield, they are rather slow to turn and target the enemy. By installing a rotating turret on the tanks, they could fire at different directions without too much effort."
 mil_tech_cs_86_desc: "Rocket artillery mounted on trucks is much more mobile compared to gun artillery. They can also fire several rockets at once achieving a much greater rate of fire."
 mil_tech_cs_87_desc: "Extremely powerful nuclear bombs are capable of destroying entire cities in seconds. Even if not used, they have a demoralizing effect on the enemy as they know that their hometowns could be decimated by a press of a button."
 mil_tech_cs_88_desc: "Combat experience during the World Wars had shown that most infantry combat was most likely won by the one with the highest rate of fire. From this experience was developed the assault rifle, which maximizes the rate of fire while having minimal recoil and reload time."
 mil_tech_cs_89_desc: "The main battle tank is designed for filling the direct fire role in modern armies."
 mil_tech_cs_90_desc: "With the help of a guidance system, our missiles will have a significantly increased chance of hitting their targets even across great distances."
 mil_tech_cs_91_desc: "The main battle tank, designed for filling direct fire roles in modern armies, is due for an upgrade."
 mil_tech_cs_92_desc: "The Future Soldeir Project is a technological and military plan to outfit modern armies with the finest top-of-the-line technologies, creating the ideal modern soldier."
 mil_tech_cs_93_desc: "What is stronger than a man? A man reinforced by steel, electricity, and hydraulic power."
 mil_tech_cs_94_desc: "Laser technology has proved immeasureably useful in the past, militarily, and now the old technology must be brought into a new age of warfare."
 mil_tech_cs_95_desc: "By developing robots for the riskiest and most physically demanding tasks, we could decrease the risks our soldiers have to face. Machines also never have to rest and they know no fear."
 mil_tech_cs_96_desc: "Sterile field generators allow for battlefield procedures to be completed without the fear of lacking a clean, sterile environment."
 mil_tech_cs_97_desc: "In the future, the role of robots and indirect warfare seem to be increasing, and the wars will likely be fought over the increasingly limited resources of the earth."
 mil_tech_cs_98_desc: "In the future, the role of robots and indirect warfare seem to be increasing, and the wars will likely be fought over the increasingly limited resources of the earth."
 mil_tech_cs_99_desc: "In the future, the role of robots and indirect warfare seem to be increasing, and the wars will likely be fought over the increasingly limited resources of the earth."

 adm_tech_cs_0_desc: "The most basic unit of governance is an extended family where all members of a community claim kinship with each other, a tribe in other words."
 adm_tech_cs_1_desc: "In tribal despotism the tribe is controlled by an individual ruler with unlimited power and the ability to exercise any action without consequence or retribution, often ruling through fear."
 adm_tech_cs_2_desc: "In tribal federation a confederation of tribes rule with a certain degree of internal autonomy but are nationally governed by a central authority."
 adm_tech_cs_3_desc: "In tribal democracy all the members of the tribe are allowed to make their voice heard and influence how their tribe should be governed."
 adm_tech_cs_4_desc: "In a barbarian tribe the strongest often gets to be the king. After the king's death, the title is passed on to his children, if can prove to be capable."
 adm_tech_cs_5_desc: "Domestication is the process whereby living organisms are changed through generations of selective breeding to accentuate traits that ultimately benefit humans."
 adm_tech_cs_6_desc: "Animal husbandry is the management and care of farm animals by humans for profit, in which genetic qualities and behaviour, considered to be advantageous to humans, are further developed."
 adm_tech_cs_7_desc: "By building large monuments, we can please the gods and prove the glory of our people."
 adm_tech_cs_8_desc: "A simple calendar would be useful for farmers as they could see the optimal times for planting and harvesting."
 adm_tech_cs_9_desc: "Shines are small structures where people gather to worship the gods. Building more of them could strengthen our religion."
 adm_tech_cs_10_desc: "A granary is a storehouse or room in a barn for threshed grain or animal feed. The stored supply of food will help us survive though bad harvests."
 adm_tech_cs_11_desc: "Governing a country requires money and one of the most effective ways to get some, is to gather a regular tax from the people."
 adm_tech_cs_12_desc: "Choosing the direction a country is going to take is perhaps the toughest choice a ruler will ever face. National ideas are the concepts that will shape our country for years to come."
 adm_tech_cs_13_desc: "Rainfall is a critical factor to the success of our agriculture. Irrigation will help offset droughts and bring less fertile lands into cultivation."
 adm_tech_cs_14_desc: "Building large forges will allow us to produce more weapons and other metal objects quickly."
 adm_tech_cs_15_desc: "Different historical periods are reflected in literature. National and tribal sagas, accounts of the origin of the world and of customs, and myths which sometimes carry moral or spiritual messages predominate in the pre-urban eras."
 adm_tech_cs_16_desc: "The class system is a social stratification in which people are grouped into a set of hierarchical social categories, the most common being the upper, middle, and lower classes."
 adm_tech_cs_17_desc: "In a monarchy the country is ruled by the king who holds absolute power over his people. However, the nobles can hold significant amounts of power."
 adm_tech_cs_18_desc: "Music was an important part of social and cultural life among ancient civilizations. Greek musical literacy created a flowering of music development."

 adm_tech_cs_21_desc: "Among the earliest government types known to man, the country is ruled by a single individual with undefined power."
 adm_tech_cs_22_desc: "The introduction of wheels to replace the runner allowed the weight of the plough to increase, and in turn allowed the use of a much larger mouldboard faced in metal. These heavy ploughs led to greater food production and eventually a significant population increase."
 adm_tech_cs_23_desc: "Constructing great temples will unite our people through religion and provide a great excuse to collect some extra money from them."
 adm_tech_cs_24_desc: "Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language."
 adm_tech_cs_25_desc: "Ancient horse harnesses pressed against the horse's muscles and trachea which restricted its breathing and reduced the pulling power. The collar allows a horse to use its full strength when pulling, essentially allowing the horse to push forward with its hindquarters into the collar."
 adm_tech_cs_26_desc: "Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons. Crop rotation gives various benefits to the soil like the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of green manure in sequence with cereals and other crops."
 adm_tech_cs_27_desc: "Constructing proper buildings requires proper tools. With more advanced tools we can produce products with greater presicion and efficiency."
 adm_tech_cs_28_desc: "Since the early history of domestication of the horse, working animals were found to be exposed to many conditions that created breakage or excessive hoof wear. The invention of the horseshoe resolved these problems."
 adm_tech_cs_29_desc: "A watermill is a structure that uses a water wheel or turbine to drive a mechanical process such as flour, lumber or textile production, or metal shaping."
 adm_tech_cs_30_desc: "With the beginning of the Middle Ages, our wisest men have come up some new ideas we could adopt."
 adm_tech_cs_31_desc: "Serfdom is the status of peasants under feudalism, specifically relating to manorialism. It is a condition of bondage or modified slavery."
 adm_tech_cs_32_desc: "The empire is the highest ranked form of government. It is used for a large sprawling group of states that are united and ruled by a single individual."
 adm_tech_cs_33_desc: "A windmill is a machine that converts the energy of wind into rotational energy by means of vanes called sails or blades. Windmills were originally developed for milling grain for food production."
 adm_tech_cs_34_desc: "In a feudal system the power is shared between the monarch and the nobles, where labor or military services are offered in exchange for land."
 adm_tech_cs_35_desc: "In a theocracy the nation is governed by the clergy in the name of God."
 adm_tech_cs_36_desc: "Monastery is a building where monks or nuns live in seclusion and celibacy practicing various religious activities."
 adm_tech_cs_37_desc: "A principality is very similar to feudal monarchy, but the monarch uses the title of prince or another title within the generic use of the term prince."

 adm_tech_cs_42_desc: "Improvements in the design of ploughs can reduce the workload on draft animals, allowing them to do more work."
 adm_tech_cs_43_desc: "Theology is the systematic and rational study of concepts of God and of the nature of religious truths, or the learned profession acquired by completing specialized training in religious studies."
 adm_tech_cs_44_desc: "Administrative institutions often grow out of the personal servants of high officials. This develops a complex administrative structure, where appointments to it were made entirely by inheritance or patronage and not on merit, and it was also possible for officers to employ other people to carry out their official tasks but continue to draw their salary themselves."
 adm_tech_cs_45_desc: "Housing the machinery of government is as important as the machinery itself."
 adm_tech_cs_46_desc: "The idea that a machine can be decomposed into simple movable elements led Archimedes to define the lever, pulley and screw as simple machines. By the time of the Renaissance this list increased to include the wheel and axle, wedge and inclined plane."
 adm_tech_cs_47_desc: "As social organization improves, so do things like food production. Increasing food production allows a society to upkeep people who aren't producers of food themselves. This leads to creation of a military elite, to defend against enemy's military elite. Supporting of the military elite is the basis of the feudal system."
 adm_tech_cs_48_desc: "With a military elite to govern our society, the next stage of development is to have a literate class of administrators. Usually these will be drawn from the ranks of clergy."
 adm_tech_cs_49_desc: "Promotion of religion will be crucial for the stability of the realm. It is not enough to be great, people must be able to see our greatness. The ancients knew how to display their greatness and we will do the same by building monuments to withstand the test of time."
 adm_tech_cs_50_desc: "Choosing the direction a country is going to take is perhaps the toughest choice a ruler will ever face. National ideas are the concepts that will shape our country for years to come."
 adm_tech_cs_51_desc: "Since the time of Charlemagne, people have been experimenting with switching from classic two field rotation systems to a three field system. It is time to promote this, as it will increase the amount of land devoted to growing food crops."
 adm_tech_cs_52_desc: "The notion of a noble oligarchy ruling the society has existed, since well, at least the Roman times, and remained popular in some parts of the world. Now this idea is once more gaining popularity amongst those who matter."
 adm_tech_cs_53_desc: "The problem with a hereditary local nobility is that they tend to value their local interests over those of the rest of the nation. We need to steadily expand the reach of the government, which begins with two of the most important areas of administration, justice and taxation."
 adm_tech_cs_54_desc: "Although it has been in existence for a long time, the scythe somehow still isn't the most popular tool for harvesting crops. By encouraging peasants to use a scythe instead of a sickle we will improve the efficiency of our harvests."
 adm_tech_cs_55_desc: "The development of the social structure is not exclusive to the aristocracy. The clergy too have to improve their internal governance. This will assist in the development of modern thought in our country."
 adm_tech_cs_56_desc: "Textiles were manufactured since time immemorial. The invention of stocking frame in 1589 was the first step towards the industrial revolution and the beginning of mechanization. This invention would lead to increase in textile production."
 adm_tech_cs_57_desc: "In time it became apparent that a more centralized bureaucracy with administrative bodies run by educated officials employed directly by the state was a necessity for the ambitious projects of the Early Modern rulers."
 adm_tech_cs_58_desc: "The more land we can cultivate, the bigger the population we can feed in that area. Gradual improvements in drainage have led to wetlands being brought into use."
 adm_tech_cs_59_desc: "While it is true that we stand on the shoulders of our ancestors it is high time that we start to learn about the world from our own, well documented observations. By observing the world around us and by experimenting to prove or disprove our ideas about it we can reach further than those before us."
 adm_tech_cs_60_desc: "The ever increasing armies of the 16th century put bigger and harder demands on the administrative systems of states. By creating a permanent organization charged with taking care of the procuring and planning of Military supplies and by keeping more troops on the rolls even during wintertime or peacetime we will in the long run be able to field large armies more cheaply and be able to support these armies more efficiently while at war."
 adm_tech_cs_61_desc: "The process to produce wrought iron was under continuous improvement and by the early 17th century the finery process came to overtake the older Osmond process. Iron production could now be specialized with the working of the iron no longer taking place at the same location as it was mined and more, stronger and purer iron would in time lead to developments in many other sectors."
 adm_tech_cs_62_desc: "The great medieval universities were of course great but they were not able to produce enough graduates to staff our growing administration. We need to expand our universities or we will fall behind."
 adm_tech_cs_63_desc: "The many and long wars of the first half of the 17th century have led to an international diplomatic system where the territorial integrity of states is a cornerstone. States rather than individual rulers or supra-national groupings are the actors on the international arena and no state has the right to intervene in the internal affairs of another."
 adm_tech_cs_64_desc: "The importance that money plays in government cannot be underestimated. The need to collect revenue is important and knowing how much revenue should be collected is even more so. We'll be setting up an office to estimate how much tax should be collected."
 adm_tech_cs_65_desc: "There are many people who demand to be given a role in the government, but in reality mostly want rewards without effort. A new interesting idea of absolutism is spreading, which is a system where we dispose of those parasites and govern alone."
 adm_tech_cs_66_desc: "Large-scale woodlands are of course useful as a source of firewood and a place for hunting, but if the trees were to go, those lands could be used for farming instead."
 adm_tech_cs_67_desc: "A new philosophical concept called constitutionalism has been developed, where the government accepts legal limits to its power. This is an intriguing idea, but I can't see it catching on."
 adm_tech_cs_68_desc: "The new sciences have given us a number of different ways to describe and measure the world around us. Let us send these learned men out into the world in general and into our country in particular. We cannot know what resources are at our disposal until we have thoroughly searched all our lands for minerals, counted every last subject and assessed every last enterprise."
 adm_tech_cs_69_desc: "Paying for the upkeep of the army, the navy and the administration itself accounts for the majority of the expenses for any state. As these are expenses that can run away quickly, however, taxes and tolls can be frustrating and inflexible ways to raise the money needed. While national debt is far from unheard of we need to come up with better plans for raising money. Bonds, tontines and other similar plans can be used both domestically and abroad to finance unforeseen expenses and will allow us to make much better use of the money we do have to develop our country."
 adm_tech_cs_70_desc: "Having the technical means to improve land and thus production is useless without incentives to do so. By reforming the laws of land tenure we can provide greater incentives to adopt improved methods of production."
 adm_tech_cs_71_desc: "An anonymous treatise on political theory has emerged, and despite efforts to suppress it it is quickly spreading across the world. It deals with the nature of forms of government, be they monarchies, despotisms, or democracies, and argues for a strict separation of the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. This would protect the people and limit the power of a monarch, which is understandably a very popular prospect for many of our subjects. Despite the unfortunate implications for the power of monarchs, these ideas may well benefit our nation greatly."
 adm_tech_cs_72_desc: "In order to make the most of the lands and subjects we control we must enlarge, reorganize and professionalize our bureaucracy. A robust organization can handle each part of our state and eliminate the need for ad hoc solutions. Let us put our universities at work to consider the best ways to efficiently rule and govern and let us encourage the sons of the nobility to serve the state with a pen in hand rather than a sword."
 adm_tech_cs_73_desc: "The basic plow in use in Europe has been unchanged since the Roman times. Now, thanks to improvements in design, the same plough can be made much lighter, reducing workload on draft animals, allowing them to do more work."
 adm_tech_cs_74_desc: "At the forefront of current revolutionary thought is the radical notion of equality for all. Philosophers from different parts of the world have worked together to create a document entitled the 'Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen', proclaiming that these rights are universal and should be enforced by law. It is likely that this will have ample repercussions for the development and spread of the concepts of freedom and democracy, and we would do well not to lag behind."
 adm_tech_cs_75_desc: "Fortunately for us, the so called enlightened philosophers didn't restrict themselves to writing subversive political treaties, but they also have come up with ideas in the areas of science and engineering. These are a boon to our economy and have led to an increase in production."
 adm_tech_cs_76_desc: "These foolish revolutionaries think they can simply consign hundreds of years of progress to the dustbin of history, all in the name of such outlandish concepts as liberty and equality. We will defeat them through the tried and tested plan of stealing the bits and pieces of their ideas that we like."
 adm_tech_cs_77_desc: "The old hand production methods are becoming obsolete by the introduction of new machinery. We must begin industializing our country or we will fall behind our rivals in productivity."
 adm_tech_cs_78_desc: "Our scientists have discovered electricity and already built the first electric motors. This new source of power has a chance of becoming an essential tool for modern life."
 adm_tech_cs_79_desc: "In the modern world tolerance and equality are becoming increasingly important. Our advisors suggest that we look into the possibility of abolishing the idea of state religion in favor of secularism."
 adm_tech_cs_80_desc: "Making machines from regulated replaceable parts will save a lot of resources as the whole machine won't have to be replaced if just one part of it breaks."
 adm_tech_cs_81_desc: "As the ideas of equality and liberty are gaining ground, women along with many minorities that are not allowed to vote are demanding equality and a right to vote."
 adm_tech_cs_82_desc: "Assembly lines, designed for the sequential organization of workers, machines and parts, would allow faster manufacturing of goods along with decreased workload for the workers."
 adm_tech_cs_83_desc: "A sociologist named Karl Marx has come up with an idea to remove the inequality of society classes. In socialism the government would ensure that everyone has enough of everything and noone gets too rich or poor."
 adm_tech_cs_84_desc: "A new national socialist movements have been formed in some countries. They claim that democracy is outdated and ineffective and want to replace it with a fascist government."
 adm_tech_cs_85_desc: "With the increased supply of electricity we are now able to bring it to all major factories. That would allow them to produce greater amounts of products."
 adm_tech_cs_86_desc: "Many of our politicians agree that it's not good one person to have too much power. They suggest that much of the power regarding internal matters is transferred from the head of state to the parliament."
 adm_tech_cs_87_desc: "Nuclear power has proven to be capable of great destruction, but if we manage to turn this power into electricity, we could satisfy the ever growing demand."
 adm_tech_cs_88_desc: "Our scientists are researching new substances called plastics. They are moldable and durable and could be useful for numerous different purposes."
 adm_tech_cs_89_desc: "All computers have so far been rather cumbersome and slow, but with more powerful ones being constantly developed, it seems like they could revolutionize the modern world."
 adm_tech_cs_90_desc: "Experts say that we may soon run out of fossil fuels and that using them pollutes the atmosphere. They suggest we look for alternative, renewable energy sources."
 adm_tech_cs_91_desc: "Many scientists claim that fusion power is the solution to the world's energy problems. It doesn't produce pollution or nuclear waste and is more effective than any earlier form of energy."
 adm_tech_cs_92_desc: "General AI refers to AI that are intillegent and equivalent in intellectual capability to a human being, or even surpassing it. They are capable of learning."
 adm_tech_cs_93_desc: "The riches of space are untapped treasure troves. Developing sophisticated mining programs would allow us to harness these resources efficiently and with profit."
 adm_tech_cs_94_desc: "In the future of administration democracy is likely to prevail even in those parts of the world that are still ruled by despots, but one can't say for sure."
 adm_tech_cs_95_desc: "In the future of administration democracy is likely to prevail even in those parts of the world that are still ruled by despots, but one can't say for sure."

 dip_tech_cs_0_desc: "If we want something we don't have, we could get it from someone, if we in return give them something they need."
 dip_tech_cs_1_desc: "Ancient seafaring often consisted of siple rafts or small boats mainly designed for fishing."
 dip_tech_cs_2_desc: "An alphabet is a standard set of letters which is used to write one or more languages based on the general principle that the letters represent phonemes of the spoken language."
 dip_tech_cs_3_desc: "The trireme was an ancient vessel and a type of galley. It derives its name from its three rows of oars, manned with one man per oar."
 dip_tech_cs_4_desc: "Merchant ships are small and fast galleys designed primarily for trading."
 dip_tech_cs_5_desc: "The transport is a larger galley with less crew inside leaving enough room to transport regiments across the seas."
 dip_tech_cs_6_desc: "Building roads would allow our armies and traders to move faster across our country."
 dip_tech_cs_7_desc: "The classical navy consisted mainly of rowed galleys. The ships would often stand side to side and the troops inside would then engage on combat."
 dip_tech_cs_8_desc: "A naval ram an underwater prolongation of the bow of the ship to form an armoured beak. This would be driven into the hull of an enemy ship in order to puncture the hull and sink or disable that ship."
 dip_tech_cs_9_desc: "Galleys dominated the pre-medieval naval warfare, and only minor variations were noticeable between ships from different countries."
 dip_tech_cs_10_desc: "Trading goods to other goods is often vague and sometimes difficult, if one has to give half a horse for some weapons. Currency could solve many of these problems."
 dip_tech_cs_11_desc: "Basic mathematics is useful not only in construction, but also commerce."
 dip_tech_cs_12_desc: "In early naval warfare, ships were hard to sink. Combat would often happen with the technique of grappling and boarding enemy ships with soldiers."
 dip_tech_cs_13_desc: "Caravans are a group of people travelling together. They were often merchants carrying their goods over vast distances."
 dip_tech_cs_14_desc: "By trading with distant countries, we could acquire exotic goods that are highly valued among our local merchants."
 dip_tech_cs_15_desc: "Paved roads would allow our armies to move even faster across our country."
 dip_tech_cs_16_desc: "Greek fire was an incendiary weapon used in naval battles to great effect as it could continue burning while floating on water."
 dip_tech_cs_17_desc: "The dromon was a type of galley and an important warship of the Byzantine navy until they were succeeded by Italian-style galleys. It was developed from the ancient liburnian, which was the mainstay of the Roman navy during the Empire."
 dip_tech_cs_18_desc: "In naval raiding a raiding party would land from a ship to loot and pillage and then return to their ships and sail away before the enemy can retaliate."
 dip_tech_cs_19_desc: "Large rivers are difficult obstacles for armies and traders. By building bridges we could make moving across the country easier."
 dip_tech_cs_20_desc: "We could try to increase our trade profits by looking for new more distant trading partners."
 dip_tech_cs_21_desc: "Using professional well-trained merchants would increase our trade efficiency."
 dip_tech_cs_22_desc: "Creatings Shipyards specifically designed for building ships could increase the quality and speed of our shipbuilding."
 dip_tech_cs_23_desc: "Providing our sailors with proper naval training could make our navies more effective in battle."
 dip_tech_cs_24_desc: "In order to improve our own trade, it's sometimes useful to harm that of our competitors. This could be done by hiring professional privateers to steal their trade vessels."
 dip_tech_cs_25_desc: "Clinker built is a method of boat building where the edges of hull planks overlap. Later the technique was successfully used in the Viking longship and the Hanseatic cog."
 dip_tech_cs_26_desc: "Celestial navigation means navigation with the help of the stars. Its principles were already known for millenia, but was significantly improved in the Islamic Caliphate through the inventions of the kamal and the quadrant."
 dip_tech_cs_27_desc: "Improving the naval training recieved by our sailors and the soldiers on board, would increase the effectiveness of our navies."
 dip_tech_cs_28_desc: "Longships were sea vessels made and used by the Vikings from the Nordic countries for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare during the Viking Age."
 dip_tech_cs_29_desc: "A knarr is a type of ship used by the Vikings. The knarr was a cargo ship, the hull was wider, deeper and shorter than a longship, and could take more cargo and be operated by smaller crews."
 dip_tech_cs_30_desc: "Established trade networks would make it easier for traders to move across the country."
 dip_tech_cs_31_desc: "Paper money was gradually developed in China. It reduced the need for risky transporting of gold and silver, it facilitated loans, since the gold or silver never left the possession of the lender and it allowed a division of currency into credit and specie backed forms."
 dip_tech_cs_32_desc: "In the late Middle Ages the galleys ruled the mediterranean and other inland seas. They were used for raiding along the coast."
 dip_tech_cs_33_desc: "By the medieval times, the domination of galleys was broken in the open seas, where there was a greater focus on sailing ships that were used mostly for troop transport. Galleys were still the main warships in inlands seas."
 dip_tech_cs_34_desc: "Building marketplaces in order to promote trade will not only encourage commerce but also allow us to better tax it."
 dip_tech_cs_35_desc: "Making proper maps showing all major roads and ports, would make it easier for our merchants to reach foreign centers of trade."
 dip_tech_cs_36_desc: "With good bartering skill our merhants could be able to trade less valuable items to more valuable ones, turning in extra profit."
 dip_tech_cs_37_desc: "If we gather information about underwater rocks, treacherous shallows and other dangerous spots from different merchants and mark them on our maps, it would help our merchants avoid them."
 dip_tech_cs_38_desc: "The cog is a one masted trading vessel originating from northern Europe."
 dip_tech_cs_39_desc: "A compass that uses the magnetic field of earth can show the direction at open seas more accurately than the sun or the stars."
 dip_tech_cs_40_desc: "Sometime around the 12th century, northern European ships began to be built with a straight sternpost, enabling the mounting of a rudder, which was much more durable than a steering oar held over the side."
 dip_tech_cs_41_desc: "A guild is an association of artisans or merchants who control the practice of their craft in a particular town. The earliest types of guild were formed as confraternities of workers."
 dip_tech_cs_42_desc: "Creation of legal and regional infrastructure in order to promote trade will not only encourage commerce but also allow us to better tax it."
 dip_tech_cs_43_desc: "Overseas trade is very risky but also highly profitable. The development of financial instruments like letters of credit will help reduce the risk, increasing our profits."
 dip_tech_cs_44_desc: "One of the most significant inventions in medieval naval warfare was the torpedo. The torpedo ran on water with a rocket system filled with explosive gunpowder materials and had three firing points. It was a very effective weapon against ships."
 dip_tech_cs_45_desc: "Shipbuilding can mean a lot of different things, it is amazing how far you can get on a raft for example. However, this is not the same as creating a fleet to enforce policies of a state. This requires a whole different approach to the building of ships, as well as developing ways to control the navy you've build."
 dip_tech_cs_46_desc: "The patterns of trade had been seriously disrupted in the 14th century, possibly due to plagues and pandemics. Now trade is slowly beginning to recover."
 dip_tech_cs_47_desc: "The barque has a long history, beginning as an Ancient Egyptian river boat. However, since then the term has gradually come to mean a light ship."
 dip_tech_cs_48_desc: "The first true ocean-going ship. Unlike galleys and cogs, Carracks can serve the role of proper ocean-going warships."
 dip_tech_cs_49_desc: "Establishing small trade posts along major trade routes would increase the amount and effect of our trade."
 dip_tech_cs_50_desc: "By constructing fortifications along our coasts we can protect them from raids, enemy landings and blockades."
 dip_tech_cs_51_desc: "Land transportation of a lot of cargo is simply too expensive, moving it by ship is more efficient. Building shipyards will provide enough ships to do so."
 dip_tech_cs_52_desc: "With an extra boost to naval morale, our sailors will conquer the waves and rule the seas. While our colonists will be able to brave the dark corners of the world, founding new settlements farther from home than ever before."
 dip_tech_cs_53_desc: "Trade depots will offer central locations for trade goods to be accumulated and distributed from for higher trade efficiency. Dry docks will allow us to maintain a fleet able to protect our trade."
 dip_tech_cs_54_desc: "Development of the lateen sail allowed Carracks to sail much closer to the wind than earlier vessels. Enhanced maneuverability made them superior to other ships."
 dip_tech_cs_55_desc: "A Flute is a specialised cargo vessel capable of carrying a large load with a very small crew. Flutes were designed to be built cheaply and in large numbers. A useful ship if you need to move things across the oceans."
 dip_tech_cs_56_desc: "The great wharfs and jetties will act as entrepôts for the world's goods. Let us build them and prosperity will follow."
 dip_tech_cs_57_desc: "Throughout the 16th century the increasing sailing ability of ships together with a growing number of more efficient guns have led to an increasing specialization of ship types. A Man of War is a ship dedicated entirely to sea warfare with a greater number of guns and ammunition than a ship that would also have to act as a Merchantman could ever hold. In the long run this development will lead to growing permanent navies and the development of naval tactics to better fit the new realities of sea warfare."
 dip_tech_cs_58_desc: "The world is a big place and in order to develop our trade in it sometimes quite big risks must be taken. Luckily there are Merchants in our country that would be willing to do so, using mostly their own capital. By sanctioning such companies with a Government charter giving them special rights to exercise government powers as well as monopolies in certain areas we can control and encourage commercial development of everything from foreign trade contacts to our colonial possessions overseas."
 dip_tech_cs_59_desc: "Galleys were light and small, and it was very difficult to mount cannons on them. The Galleass was a larger vessel capable of carrying a broadside of cannons like a man-of-war. To compensate for this extra weight, Galleass would be equipped with an additional sail."
 dip_tech_cs_60_desc: "Galleon was created by lowering the forecastle and elongating the hull. These changes in design improved the speed and stability of the ship. Which was of vital importance for Galleons to serve as better gun platforms."
 dip_tech_cs_61_desc: "With more and more countries sending their subjects or citizens abroad on various trading ventures and with so many living so close to each other for so long times it has become absolutely essential to have at least a basic concept of common laws of the seas. With publications such as 'Mare Liberum' or the later 'De Dominio Maris Dissertatio' the foundations to an international law of the seas has been laid."
 dip_tech_cs_62_desc: "Further development of transport ships led to construction of larger and faster vessels, which still tried to maintain the simplicity of construction of the Flute. These ships fell under the generic term Merchantman."
 dip_tech_cs_63_desc: "In order to make better use of the various developments in naval warfare new tactics are required. The evolution of broadside cannon have meant that the most efficient way for ships is no longer to seek to board the other party but rather to form a line of battle to be able to maximize the amount of firepower directed at the enemy."
 dip_tech_cs_64_desc: "The War Galleon, also known as a race-built Galleon, was built by reducing the number of decks on a Galleon. This sacrificed cannons for maneuverability, which proved to be beneficial in combat."
 dip_tech_cs_65_desc: "Even at the beginning of the 17th century permanent navies were quite small and even naval powers of note would mostly maintain a naval force to meet their immediate needs. Over time, however, we are moving in the direction of a larger professional navy. Unless we want to see our rivals overtaking us in naval matters we must strive to create a larger permanent navy with an administrative structure to support it as well as ensure that a naval career can be a permanent occupation for our officers."
 dip_tech_cs_66_desc: "Originally developed by Barbary Corsairs, this galley didn't carry as many guns as a Galleas, but it was smaller and far more maneuverable. This improved maneuver allowed it to be far more effective in combat."
 dip_tech_cs_67_desc: "In 1614 a rather mad physician wrote a treatise suggesting that scurvy was a result of a dietary problem and could be solved by consuming lemon or lime juice. As it turns out, there was method in his madness and we have started providing this new diet for our sailors. Other countries call us limey now."
 dip_tech_cs_68_desc: "Original frigate design described any ship that was built for speed and maneuverability. As the concept developed though, it became its own unique class of a ship designed to support ships of the line."
 dip_tech_cs_69_desc: "A special version of the Frigate originally developed for operation in the Baltic. It kept a broadside of a frigate, but had a shallow draft and oars giving greater maneuverability in shallow waters, while sacrificing seakeeping in open oceans."
 dip_tech_cs_70_desc: "The addition of a third deck was a small sacrifice in maneuverability for a huge gain in close combat. The additional deck gave the ship an ability to fire onto the decks of smaller two-decker ships, while at the same time protecting its own deck."
 dip_tech_cs_71_desc: "The East Indiaman was the largest merchant ship built, it typically could displace in excess of 1,000 tons and measure over 175 feet in length. Those queens of the oceans were the most efficient way of moving men and cargo around the globe."
 dip_tech_cs_72_desc: "Life at sea is full of dangers and thus the punishments need to be harsh. If they do not have a sufficient deterrence effect, we will quickly run into trouble.

 HOLY_SITE_151_DESC: "Back when the city of Constantinople was still a minor town called Byzantium, what would later become the Church of Constantinople was founded there by St. Andrew, the First-Called and brother of St. Peter.

Constantinople thus became invaluable in spreading Christianity in the eastern parts of the Roman Empire."

It is here that Jesus Christ made his Triumphal entry into Jerusalem, was thereafter crucified and buried, then resurrected and ascended into heaven.

Finally, Jerusalem is also the place which saw the first ever Apostolic council."

The growing importance of the Merv region for the Church of the East is also attested by the appearance of several more nearby Christian centres during following centuries."
 HOLY_SITE_451_DESC: "Kabul was one of the most prosperous and well defended cities of Afghanistan. And to the Zunbils, it also played a major role in the Zunist faith by the presence of several temples in the area, possibly Buddhist and Zunist ones. It stood as a bastion against Islam in the 7th and 8th century CE, culturally and politically Indian. It was captured finally in 870 and changed hands throughout the middle ages, regularly conquered by a rising empire and seeing its fall."
 HOLY_SITE_506_DESC: "Standing in the city of Multan is a solar temple of outmost importance for the Zunbils, dedicated to Surya, as one of the other names or homologue deities of Zhun would be Aditya (another name for Surya), the solar deity of Hinduism. The temple is an important place of pilgrimage and wealth and was already present in the 7th century CE and might have had Buddhist or Zoroastrian origins. It was destroyed in the late 10th century."
 HOLY_SITE_739_DESC: "For ages, Kashgar has been an important city along the silk road, acting as a gateway between China and the Middle East.

Later on, Kashgar also became a metropolitan see."
 HOLY_SITE_1947_DESC: "In Cenci rests the Arunachalesvara temple, devoted to the Hindu deity Shiva.

Constructed possibly as early as the 1st century BCE, it stands as a place of worship for the aspect of fire, Agni, and was also certainly rebuilt or improved by the Chola in the 9th century CE, contemporary to the Zunbils."
 HOLY_SITE_2229_DESC: "The capital of Zabulistan, Bust, is the heart of its faith. Not much is known about the temples to Zhun, but a divine statue of Him lays on the sacred mountain close by and appears to have been brought here by the Hephthalites, tearing down an older god in its stead."
 HOLY_SITE_2269_DESC: "The Apostleship of Edessa is the oldest center of eastern Christianity, founded by St. Peter, St. Thomas and St. Bartholomew and first lead by St. Thaddeus, one of the seventy disciples, who was martyred in 66 AD."

 HOLY_SITE_2673_DESC: "In Aksum stands The Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion, which was built in the 4th century during the reign of Ezana, the first Christian ruler of the ancient Aksumite empire.

 akritai: "Akritai"
 akritaiDESCR: "Akritai were the frontier troops of the Thematic armies and were responsible, like the Limitanei before them, to repel small raids from the Arabs and later on the Turks. Unlike their limitanei predecessors, the Akritai's income was supplemented with land they lived on and maintained. Armed with light javelins, a large shield, and a sword, the Akritai were fairly close in armament to the Late Roman Army, and although not as well trained as the earlier Limitanei, did their job well."
 hippo_akontistai: "Hippo Akontistai"
 hippo_akontistaiDESCR: "The Hippo Akontistai were mounted Akontistai, or skirmishers, who used large numbers of light javelins to perform skirmishing, scouting, and other duties.

 skoutatoi: "Skoutatoi"
 skoutatoiDESCR: "Beginning in the 9th Century, the Romans began reconquering the lands taken from them, and at the head of these reconquests were the Skoutatoi, main-line Roman infantry from the Thematic armies.

 pronoiarioiDESCR: "The Pronoiars were men granted land and fiscal responsibility in exchange for providing troops when called upon. Essentially, they made up the Roman feudal system. The Pronoiars were formalized by Alexios Komnenos as a result of the collapse of the Anatolian theme system and a new method was needed for the Empire's administrative management and defense. Pronoiars fought on both foot and horse, depending on how much they could afford, but much of their equipment was still standardized and provided by the Roman state."

 archontopoulaiDESCR: "The Archontopoulai were an elite cataphract guard created by Alexios Komnenos, who recruited teenage orphans and trained them for years to become Kataphraktoi. Armed with lances, fully armored horses and riders, and bows, they were often used in his campaigns and could be a decisive factor in battle. With the support of the Varangians, Pronoiarioi, and the remaining Tagmatic units, they made for a winning combination in the 11th and 12th centuries."
 mourtatoi: "Mourtatoi"
 mourtatoiDESCR: "The Mourtatoi were a unit of Roman guard archers recruited from the Turkomans and Turkomens, as well as the various Beyliks, in Anatolia. The Mourtatoi guard were one of several guard units that included the Paramonai and Varangioi, which formed the core of the drastically reduced Roman army. The Mourtatoi were foot archers, armed with Turkish Bows, Armor, and Paramenion Sabres. They proved invaluable, faithfully fighting to their deaths against the Ottomans in 1453."
 paramonai: "Paramonai"
 paramonaiDESCR: "The Paramonai were the Greek guard, one of the few units actually comprised of Greek recruits, rather than mercenaries. They were effectively heavy infantry and heavy cavalry, and were a sort of backbone to the other mercenary and militia troops the Empire used at the time. The Paramonai seem to have been disbanded with the loss of the Greek provinces in the mid-1300s."
 kavalarioi: "Kavalarioi"
 kavalarioiDESCR: "Kavalarioi were medium cavalry in use since the early theme system and would survive as a unit until the time of the fall of Trapezounta in 1461. They were armored lancers who took the place of the old Kataphraktoi, whose tactics were becoming outdated. More maneuverable than heavy armored cataphracts, they would exploit openings in the battle line or drive away enemy cavalry, as well as generally defend the flanks of the formation."
 allagion: "Allagion"
 allagionDESCR: "With the restoration of Constantinople the Roman Army once more had a core of professional soldiers. However, the gains in the Balkans were offset by losses in Anatolia, in the end resulting in continuing decline. The new organization of Roman Skoutatoi into Allagia was more effective than the old Moira. These men were heavy infantry whose manpower was supplied by the Pronoiarioi, and were equipped with armor, swords, and large shields in the traditional manner of the Skoutatoi."
 skythikon: "Skythikon"
 skythikonDESCR: "The 14th century, with the coming and collapse of the Mongols, saw the return of 'Scythian' cavalry in Roman service, recruited from the Blue Horde and Golden Horde. Mongol, Cuman, and Pecheneg mercenaries helped the Romans fight the Turks in Anatolia, and probably carried gunpowder into Europe through the Turks and the Romans. Their methods were effective, but eventually the Romans lost the income to keep recruiting them and they became outmatched by Ottoman infantry archer tactics."
 latinikon: "Latinikon"
 latinikonDESCR: "The Romans continued to fight against the Ottomans well into the 15th century, using Italian and Germanic mercenaries called Latinikon. The Latinikon were armed with contemporary Italian equipment supplied by the Roman allies of Venice and Genoa, which usually was a full hooded suit of chainmail, a leather jacket, and a Celata helmet, with large triangular shields and spears and swords. The Latinikon rarely fought in open battle, with notable exceptions being the campaign of 1444 where the Romans reconquered up to Athens, before being driven back to the Hexamilion and defeated. Better equipped and trained than their Ottoman opponents, the Latinikon fought to the end at Constantinople in 1453."
 stratioitai: "Stratioitai"
 stratioitaiDESCR: "Stratiotai is the Greek word for 'soldier' and these men were mounted Latinikon armed with Paramenion Sabres and full suits of mail, recruited from noble families settled by the Venetians throughout the Balkans. Although in the early 15th century they all went into service of the Romans, later on they would continue to fight the Turks in the name of Venice until the late 16th century, and most of their noble lines survive until the modern day."
 heriban: "Heriban"
 heribanDESCR: "A heriban was a levy of Germani militia, who would be armed primarily with spears and shields, and other than that had to provide their own equipment. They were usually zealous individuals intent on defending their homes, but had little training or experience in warfare. However, they could be relied upon to execute effective ambushes and hold the line, when necessary."
 hridriskara: "Hridriskara"
 hridriskaraDESCR: "Hridriskara were Germanic cavalry skirmishers, armed with shields and javelins. Their horses were usually stunted ploughorses, and they made for agile raiders and good skirmishers on the battlefield. Like their infantry counterparts, they had little training, little experience, and had to provide their own equipment."
 alemanne: "Alemanne"
 alemanneDESCR: "As agricultural techniques improved, so did trade with the Romans and the quality of living. This process began about 150 AD and allowed Germanic Soldiers to afford more equipment and training, hence the Alemanne. Although still militia, the Alemanne was a slightly better organization that was used by the various Suebic groups, including the Alemanni, Marcomanni, and Quaddi. Due to agricultural improvements these men could campaign longer and their raids were more successful."
 chnite: "Chnite"
 chniteDESCR: "Chnite were germanic lancers, armed usually with a spear and shield, and whatever else they could afford. Although militia, they were more effective at engaging enemy cavalry than their Hridiriskara counterparts, and adopted some of their tactics from the Sarmatian Roxolani and Iazyges to their East. The Chnite would eventually become the origin of the term 'Knight' as many of these men were low-ranking chieftains or those landlords under the chieftain's influence."
 89chiro: "Type 89 I-Go"
 89chiroDESCR: "Weighing 12.8 tons, with three machine guns and strong and light steel plate. The Type 89 design was completed in April 1929, with production starting in 1931, making this the first tank to be mass-produced in Japan. The Type 89 had two variants - the Ko ('A') version, which used a water-cooled gasoline engine, and the Otsu ('B') version, with an air-cooled diesel engine and improved frontal armor."
 type62: "Norinco Type 62"
 type62DESCR: "Designed for use in the difficult terrain of Southern China, the Type 62 was created with mountains, hills and lakes in mind, and so has an advantage over many other tanks in these areas. Armed with a main gun plus three machine guns, the Type 62 is nonetheless quite light. The tank loses weight by being small and having thinner armour than many other tanks."
 type90: "Type 90 Kyu-maru"
 type90DESCR: "The Type 90 Kyu-maru is the current main battle tank of the Japanese army. Entering service in 1990, the Type 90 Kyu-maru achieves manpower savings by reducing the crew to three through the development of the turret bustle autoloader. This design allows the tank crew to operate without a loader, which allows the use of a smaller turret."
 pugnarii: "Pugnarii"
 pugnariiDESCR: "Barbarian troops had almost always fallen to the heavily armed and armoured legionaires in the past, but now manpower was desperately short in the Western Empire. The solution was to mix the forces of Foederati with native, heavier Roman troops in the same division. The Roman troops made up the backbone of these forces, and received special training in working with the Foederati. Such armies were called simply 'Pugnarii' meaning 'fists' or 'fighters', and maintained the power of old legions while keeping the numbers needed to fight the barbarians."
 novaetestudo: "Novae Testudo"
 novaetestudoDESCR: "With the Medieval Warm Period comes increased crop yields and thus increased population. With the increases in population the Empire is once again able to field its traditional heavy infantry which was so effective in the past and which is vital against the worsening viking menace."
 graeciprocur: "Graeci Procursatoribus"
 graeciprocurDESCR: "Roman battles were fought on two fronts at this point, one front in Greece, the other in Gaul and Germania. While the heavy Roman troops that had been the mainstay of Roman armies since the foundation of the Empire were highly effective in the relatively flat terrain of Gaul and Germania, in the rough terrain of Greece they were much less effective. Local skirmishers were thus used by the Romans for any campaigns in Greece."
 ascensoreshun: "Ascensores Hun"
 ascensoreshunDESCR: "The 'Hunnic riders' were in fact not Huns at all, the real Huns having been beaten back centuries ago. These riders nonetheless continued the Hunnic horse-bow strategy, which was extremely effective against the once more dominantly infantry-based enemies of Rome."
 waldensian: "Waldensian"
 waldensian_religion_desc: "The Waldensians (also known variously as Waldenses, Vallenses, Valdesi or Vaudois) are a Christian movement and religious cultural group which appeared first in Lyon and spread to the Cottian Alps in the late 1170s. The movement originated in the late twelfth century as the Poor Men of Lyons, a band organized by Peter Waldo, a wealthy merchant who gave away his property around 1173, preaching apostolic poverty as the way to perfection. Waldensian teachings quickly came into conflict with the Roman Catholic Church. By 1215, the Waldensians were declared heretical and subject to intense persecution; the group was nearly annihilated in the seventeenth century and were confronted with organized and generalized discrimination in the centuries that followed."

 et_waldensian_events.EVTDESC1: "A recently emerged Christian movement known as Waldensianism has been gaining followers among the common folk in some of our provinces. The followers reject the idea of indulgence, purgatory, the worshipping of saints and relics. They also denounce the wealth of the Church and volunteer for a life in poverty.

 2AD_ERA_OF_EMPIRES_DESC: "Culminating in the ascension and consolidation of the rule of Caesar Augustus and the de facto establishment of the Roman Empire, Rome had gradually established itself as the undisputed hegemon of the Mediterranean, known to the Romans as Mare Nostrum, or 'Our Sea,' defeating all rivals such as the Carthaginians, Macedonians, Seleukids and Ptolemies. In the lands of Persia and Mesopotamia, the Parthians have established a mighty empire rivaling that of the Romans. To the east, the Son of Heaven continues to rule as the emperor of the Han dynasty, faced by their nomadic rivals the Xiongnu Confederation in the north, who rule over their own steppe empire. In India, the collapse of the Mauryan and Shunga dynasties have resulted in several competing kingdoms in northern India, while the Satavahana Empire continues to dominate the Deccan. Meanwhile, the last remnant of Alexander's great empire, the kingdom of the Indo-Greeks, continues to hold out to the last man. Shall this era be known as one of great empires, or shall it be known for great collapse?"
 FIVE_DYNASTIES_NAME: "Five Dynasties, Ten Kingdoms"
 FIVE_DYNASTIES_DESC: "The prosperous Tang dynasty, which had been described as China's Golden Age, collapses due to internal strife, natural disasters and the increasing influence of various Jiedushi, or military governors, of the empire. Upon its collapse, the Jiedushi establish their own kingdoms and dynasties within their respective regions of governance and all vie for the Mandate of Heaven. This chaotic period would see a series of short-lived unifications followed by further disunification, and Tang Chinese borders would effectively remain divided until the Mongols invade China and establish the Yuan dynasty, long after Genghis Khan's own death."
 IMJIN_NAME: "Imjin War"

As a result, a power struggle ensues between the two main candidates of inheritance, the brothers Kublai Khan and Ariq Böke. Meanwhile, Berke Khan of the Golden Horde and Hulagu Khan of the Ilkhanate wage their own war over the controversy of Hulagu's bloody sacking of Baghdad, as Berke had recently converted to Islam. Thus, the Empire fractures into four, an almost inevitable outcome foreshadowed since the days of Genghis Khan, who, against better judgement, had retracted a decision of an earlier kurultai to divide the empire among able administrators, and instead chose to divide his empire among his four eldest sons; the Khan's familial affection had divided of the empire he founded."
 SEKIGAHARA_NAME: "Battle of Sekigahara"
 SEKIGAHARA_DESC: "Following the death of the Oda clan's regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi, rulership of Japan fell to his seven year old son. However, the increasingly influential Tokugawa clan saw this only as an opportunity to claim Japan for himself. As a result, two factions emerged, the Western Army loyal to the Toyotomi, and the Eastern Army loyal to the Tokugawa. Tensions continued to escalate, until a letter to the Tokugawa clan's head, Tokugawa Ieyasu, from an Uesugi clan's retainer, Kanetsugu Naoe, finally sparked open hostilities, bluntly stating 'Words are no longer necessary.' The showdown that would finally bring the nearly century-and-a-half long Sengoku Jidai to an end was about to begin."
 SPANISHAMERICAN_NAME: "Spanish-American War"
 SPANISHAMERICAN_DESC: "The USS Maine mysteriously sinks off the coast of Cuba, giving the United States pretense to declare war on Spain.

The empire long united, must divide; long divided, must unite."

 LAST_ROMAN_EXPEDITION_DESC: "Decades after the fall of Rome to Odoacer, new powerful Germanic kingdoms established themselves throughout the corners of the former empire. However, the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I makes it his mission to restore the lands surrounding Mare Nostrum under Roman rule once more. For some time, the kingdom of the Vandals in Africa had fended off the Roman Empire, while the Goths in Italia maintain a strong hold over the Germanic realm in the west; this balance of power would be shaken by the arrival of Belisarius and the ambitions of Justinian."

Although once a major enemy of the Hashimites and initially in opposition to Islam, the Umayyads had converted to the faith in 627 shortly before the emergence of the Rashidun Caliphate. Viewing themselves as the true spiritual and temporal successor to the Rashidun, the Umayyads now aimed to overcome civil war and expand the borders of Islam and the Caliphate."
 SACK_OF_ROME_NAME: "The Sack of Rome"
 SACK_OF_ROME_DESC: "The eternal city of Rome is sacked by the great King Alaric of the Visigoths, marking the first time since the city was sacked by the Gauls almost eight centuries ago.

However, the fledgling dynasty found an obstacle in establishing a sphere of influence with neighboring polities that was to be expected of the Son of Heaven. While most neighboring states accepted the Sui as their overlord, the kingdom of Goguryeo in Korea insisted that they maintained equal relations. In response to raids by the Sui along their borders, the King of Goguryeo launches a preemptive strike into Sui lands while the Celestial Emperor gathers the strongest army ever seen by a Chinese state in the past three hundred years; little did the Emperor of the Sui know that his army, said to be over a million strong, would encounter severe logistical challenges during their campaign."
 RUSSO_JAPANESE_WAR_NAME: "Russo-Japanese War"
 RUSSO_JAPANESE_WAR_DESC: "As the newly-modernized Empire of Japan expands its influence across the sea, the looming Empire of Russia seeks to acquire warm-water ports along the Pacific. Russia thus begins building a railway through Manchuria; believing they could not stand up to Russia militarily, Japan attempts negotiations that would acknowledge Manchuria as Russian territory while Japan would hold on to northern Korea. At the same time, Japan's recent alliance with Great Britain meant that Germany and France would avoid involvement if a conflict between Russia and Japan erupted; therefore, Japan did not have any qualms with starting hostilities against Russia. Thus, when these negotiations were unsuccessful, Japan launched a preemptive attack on Russian ships, sparking the Russo-Japanese War."

On a grander scale, the League of Nations, which the United States had formed but failed to join, attempts to repair a world torn by war.

How events transpire will decide the longevity of the young Commonwealth and its grasp over the seas surrounding the Isles."
 AUSTRO_PRUSSIAN_WAR_NAME: "Austro-Prussian War"
 AUSTRO_PRUSSIAN_WAR_DESC: "Despite how long the German identity had existed, there had never been a centralized, proper German state in history. Austria was threatened by the quickly-emerging power of Prussia and its growing military and economy, and rightfully so; many German nationalists including Otto von Bismarck dreamed of one day unifying all of the German peoples under one German state. When conflict arose between Austria and Prussia over Schleswig-Holstein, Prussia used the conflict as pretext for war and mobilized against the Austrian Empire. At the same time, the Kingdom of Italy allies with Prussia to seize Venice from Austrian control in Italy's third war of independence. What the German diet decided was no longer a factor; in Bismarck's own words, the German Confederation had, at that moment, ended."

Still, the Protestant movement grows, and by 1525 the Duchy of Prussia is the first to adopt Lutheranism as a state religion. Meanwhile, the Italian Four Years' War rages on, with France and Venice facing the Holy Roman Empire and Spain; even this conflict is not uninfluenced by the Reformation, as the Pope sides with the newly elected Emperor Charles V over France to gain an ally against Martin Luther. None, however, could predict the millions of deaths to come in the ensuing wars of religion."
 PEACE_OF_WESTPHALIA_NAME: "Peace of Westphalia"
 PEACE_OF_WESTPHALIA_DESC: "A series of peace treaties are signed, recognizing the international system of sovereign states and for the most part ending the European Wars of Religion, which had claimed millions of lives. Besides territorial changes and the recognition of various states' independence, this marked a new world order. Now, major powers relied on international law and the concept of the balance of power so that no nation would become too powerful. However, as history would show, lasting peace would not achieved, and conflict would continue between the Great Powers of Europe."

Upon learning of his father's death, Bayezid strangles his brother and becomes the sole heir to the Ottoman throne. While the Ottomans still possessed armies in the East, Serbia had lost much of their soldiers in the battle, leaving them vulnerable to foreign powers from all directions; thus, they are forced to become a vassal to the Ottoman Empire. Despite crushing losses, the Ottoman Empire has become a major power in the Balkans."

Despite this shortcoming, Timur envisioned the restoration of the Mongol Empire and saw himself as the true successor to Genghis Khan. Taking control of the Chagatai Khanate and making its khan his puppet, Timur soon began expanding his empire, and he claimed that he was supported by God in his conquests. In 1378, he aided Tokhtamysh, a descendant of Genghis Khan, in forcefully seizing the throne of the Golden Horde. However, both of these men had lofty ambitions of their own, and it shall not be long before clashing ambitions lead to all-out war; after all, there can only be one successor to the Great Khan."

Meanwhile, the great Taungu king Bayinnaung continues his conquest of Upper Burma; like Akbar, he too is destined to rule a mighty empire, as the Taungu Empire would eventually become the largest empire to ever exist in the history of Southeast Asia."

 BATTLE_OF_YILING_DESC: "Since its inception, the Wu-Shu alliance had been slowly falling apart as tensions between the two powers persisted and rose until it reached a breaking point. The two states had fiercely debated over who was the rightful owner of Jing Province, and in 219 the King of Wu, Sun Quan, seized the province and executed the Shu general Guan Yu. Guan Yu was a very close friend to now-Emperor of Shu Liu Bei, and thus the latter promised nothing but destruction for his former ally. While mobilizing against Wu, his close friend and general Zhang Fei was also assassinated, which further fueled the rage of the emperor. Descending upon Jing Province with nothing in his mind but vengeance, the Wu forces found themselves pitted against an enemy whose emperor was unwilling to negotiate terms, unless the head of the King of Wu himself lay at his feet."

Shortly after, on Christmas Day in the year 800, Pope Leo crowns Charlemagne as the first Holy Roman Emperor, directly challenging the authority of the Byzantine empress, whose rule was already questioned by many due to the unprecedented nature of being the sole female ruler of Byzantium. Empress Irene herself may have even considered marrying Charlemagne to form an alliance between the two empires, though it continues to remain clear to all that there can only be one Roman Empire."

The pathetic Romans could only look on in horror as we pillaged their great Eternal City as if it were just another common town ripe for plunder.

With the expansion of the Toyotomi realm, we too may have the ability to create our own firearms, severing the need for any middlemen or over-reliance on the European firearms trade.

With many of our laws dating back to the times of Augustus and even the Roman Republic, we would benefit greatly from a clear set of codified laws.\n\nAt the same time, we now have the option for reform.

Although the three eagle standards lost at the disastrous Battle of Teutoburg had already been recovered long ago, the humiliation of such a defeat continues to be a rallying point for the Germans, and the legions themselves that fell in battle that day could never be recovered. Additionally, while Rome under Augustus and his successors retaliated against the Germans and saw success, we never truly established a permanent Roman presence in the lands of Germania, unlike the richer provinces of Gallia and Hispania. Through acquiring significant, permanent gains in the heartlands of Germania, however, we have recovered our pride and reinvigorated the Roman war machine. Though Germania in the past was a land that was of no use to us, the Germanic threat that continues today has shown us that the Germanic threat must be vanquished thoroughly!"

Separated from mainland Europe by a channel, the lands of Britannia are among our least prioritized domains, especially as we continue to face threats from the east as well as from within. Thus, the limitanei of Britannia are more isolated than ever, yet they still continue to stand guard against barbarian threats to the north and west, steadfast and battle-ready along the newly-fortified defenses of Hadrian's Wall in the far north."

Though they possess many traditions that are quite different from the Romans of Italia, their assimilation of key Roman culture, ideals and ways of life has made them perhaps even closer to us Romans than even their Briton and Celtic cousins."

With the Roman Empire, it became standard for the ruler of the empire to be granted the title of 'imperator' regardless of their achievements. With the recent victories in the lands of the Greeks, our Imperator [Root.Monarch.GetName] invokes the glorious martial image of the imperators of old as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] parades through both Rome and Constantinople, a clear display of the martial might of Rome and the triumph of the West over the pretender forces of the East."

However, these lands of Germania are home to many adversaries of the Roman Empire who continue to defy Roman hegemony to this day. Thus, our armies have successfully marched in the lands of Magna Germania, claimed its territories and subjugated its peoples as fully-integrated subjects of the empire. Even now, there are many of Germanic descent who hold prominent positions in our empire, just as the early empire had led to emperors from Egypt, Syria and Hispania.

The Cruz de la Victoria, the 'Cross of Victory,' is a splendid jeweled cross from the age of the Asturian kinship. According to legend, the cross was carried by Pelagius of Asturias in battle against the Moors at Covadonga, the battle and first Asturian victory that marked the beginning of the Reconquista.

When the Roman general Marcus Antonius returned to Parthia to avenge Crassus' humiliating defeat, our Parthian light cavalry devastated the Roman ranks once more - the Roman campaign was a disaster, and we Parthians sent them running back to Rome.\n\nSince then, our light cavalry have trained hard day and night to master the use of the Parthian shot in all types of terrains and weather conditions.

Great Parthian rulers and generals such as Mithridates the Great conquered the lands and satraps of the Seleukids, including the domains of Persia, Media and Babylonia, expanding the Parthian realm from a revolter kingdom to an empire rivaling that of the Greeks and Romans. However, we never truly had the opportunity to finish what we started, as the Romans subjugated the Seleukid heartland of Syria before we could do so.

Additionally, the Zoroastrian priests continue to kindle the fires of Cappadocia, and many Cappadocians still remain pious to this shared faith of ours.

Many of the northern Thai and Mon peoples in these lands had previously enjoyed autonomy from the various powerful Mon and Khmer polities that otherwise dominated much of the region. Thus, perhaps they would serve us better as direct vassals of us within our mandala.

Many Thais already live in this city, and its population and prosperity continue to grow over the years. Thus, should we promote the Thai settlement of Ayodhaya, now known in our Thai tongue as Ayutthaya, or should we promote migration of Ayutthaya Thais to our capital city of $CAPITAL_CITY$?"

The Lao people are a Tai peoples just like us, and even after much time we still share linguistic and cultural similarities that make us closer to cousins than strangers.

We have never truly attempted marketing or exporting Thai silk beyond our domains, as Thai silk is mostly produced for personal use. However, a Chinese diplomat who arrived in our capital of $CAPITAL_CITY$ noted that our silk products could have potential in foreign markets.

However, the rise of the Khmer and Thai kingdoms severely weakened the Mon polities, and many of the Mon city-states were subjugated by the Khmer Empire and the Thais.

Meroe is home to many treasures dating back multiple centuries, and most of the denizens of the city have already accepted whatever fate may befall them.

Known in the local Ethiopian language of Ge'ez as 'Tewahedo', meaning 'united as one,' a new belief among our peoples argues that there is a perfect union of the divine and human natures of Christ, rather than the belief in Rome and Greece that Christ possesses two natures, divine and human.

 mmetr_SHU_Han_mission_events.7.desc: "Since Yi Province is one of the least densely-populated provinces in all of the Han, it is especially important for us to efficiently and accurately recruit individuals of unique and rare talent into our administration. Thus, we have established multiple reading book residences across the country which promote writing and education through Confucian texts and open discussion.\n\nOur capital city of $CAPITAL_CITY$ has the largest and most notable of these residences, known as the Tai Xue Fu, or 'Great Education Residence.' At the Great Education Residence, discussions of various topics ranging from politics to economics to philosophy to military matters is promoted - this allows our state to discover and recruit individuals of talent who would have otherwise lived out their lives in obscurity."

 mmetr_SHU_Han_mission_events.8.desc: "The city of Chengdu has prospered since the reign of the Qin, serving as a key breadbasket for both the Qin and Han imperial dynasties and earning the nickname 'Land of Abundance.' Through further patronage and development, we have turned Chengdu into a major producer of silk, one of our main and most lucrative exports. The prestige and splendor of Chengdu has become so great that it has become known as the 'City of Silk,' an impressive achievement considering it is but one of many centers of silk production across all of the Middle Kingdom."

Thanks to the capable guiding hand of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName], we have successfully implemented the tuntian system, a system in which land abandoned in times of war is settled by soldiers as agricultural colonies, providing additional food in times of peace as well as times of war.\n\nAnother innovation developed by our brightest minds is known as the 'flowing horse.' Since the early Han dynasty, the wooden oxen was a wheeled cart used to carry goods and supplies in long campaigns. To make transport more efficient, the Shu Chancellor Zhuge Liang invented the flowing horse; while the wooden oxen is pulled from front, the flowing horse improves upon the wooden oxen and is pushed from the back. This device allows us to feed a greater number of troops during long campaigns."

 mmetr_SHU_Han_mission_events.10.desc: "We have established specialized bureaus for efficiently managing salt and steel production, the two most lucrative industries besides the silk trade in the lands of Yi Province. Thanks to our investments, salt production and trade is now a major source of income for our state, while the metallurgy industry of Yi allows us to craft high-quality weapons for our armies. With both of these bureaus up and running, we now have the option of choosing which industry to focus on developing further, based on what would benefit us the most in our current situation."

Our bureau has also promoted more local silk production across the land, as even the family of the Shu Chancellor Zhuge Liang had eight hundred mulberry plants for feeding silkworms. With such silk production being so commonplace, we have accumulated many pieces of silk numbering in the hundreds of thousands in our own state treasury."

Even when the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out, the eunuchs kept the Emperor ignorant of the plight of the country and the rebels across the land, and even two of the Ten Eunuchs, Feng Xu and Xu Feng, were caught and executed for conspiring with the Yellow Turban Rebels.\n\nThus, to prevent the eunuch faction from causing the downfall of our state of [Root.GetName], the true successor of the Han dynasty, we have successfully curbed the eunuch's influence while also ensuring they remain loyal to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

Reigning in Jianye, the Sun clan has been both close allies as well as bitter rivals of our dynasty - they are guilty of treachery against us, yet in many ways we could not be where we are without their assistance.\n\nWith the capture of the city of Jianye, we also captured the remaining members of the Sun clan who had not yet fled from the city. Thus, we are now faced with the difficult question of how exactly we should deal with the Sun clan. We could allow them to keep their noble status as local nobles of Wu, and we could even marry them into our royal family.

Their clan head, Cuan Xi, has been quite cooperative with our state, allying with our forces whenever they are campaigning south to quell rebellions. Thus, it may be wise to make further use of the talents of the Cuanman in our state. Furthermore, administering the southern frontierlands and keeping its peoples in line is quite difficult - perhaps granting the lands of the Cuanman autonomy under their leading clan may benefit us as well."

One of the Xianbei hostages is especially talented - the Xianbei prince is well-learned in the arts of both war and diplomacy, and they are familiar with all of the Confucian classics. As it would be a shame if their talents went to waste, it would be wise to offer them a position as a close advisor in the court of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName], which can in turn improve our relations with their Xianbei tribes of origin."

The ships protect our trade and goods and serve as the link between Funan and the rest of the known world.\n\nIn the past, we peoples of the Mekong Delta had used our great ships for piracy, targeting merchant ships carrying valuable goods between the exotic markets of India and China. However, the arrival of our founding king Kaundinya from the Kalingan shores of India changed our outlook, as Kaundinya convinced our Queen Soma to profit from peaceful trade rather than piracy. With the expansion of our naval forces as well as our merchant fleet, we are now faced with the same question of sponsoring peaceful trading or piracy."

The kingdom of Funan controls several major trading ports between China and India - the importance of these ports as well as the unrivaled quality of Funanese ships, even in comparison to our own Chinese ships, are what prompted us to exchange embassies with them in the first place.\n\nCuriously, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has become especially fascinated by the Funanese musicians that visited our court. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was so impressed with these foreign musicians that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has founded an institute for Funanese music near our capital city of $CAPITAL_CITY$, where Chinese musicians can study the musical styles of Funan."

This dynasty is also known as the Naga dynasty, as the family of Queen Soma prior to her rule was known as the Naga family, named after powerful and divine serpents known as Naga.\n\nThus, just like the Lunar and Solar dynasties of the great Indian epic the Mahabharata, we people of Funan too have our own legendary royal family under which we can rally.

Along with their territories we have also acquired the Cham's ships, manpower and expertise. Once unrivaled in the region, the Cham navies were especially skilled in naval warfare tactics such as conducting raids and blockades, boarding enemy ships, and even carrying out stealth tactics from the water.

Besides our own mountain, we have ventured further inland along the Mekong River and subjugated various other mountains and cities across the lands of the Khmer peoples. However, our kingdom has always been a maritime polity, based around thriving port cities and overseas trade. Thus, in answering the question of governing peoples farther inland from the Mekong Delta, we may be better off granting autonomy to the inland peoples and creating loyal vassals who shall rule on the behalf of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as well as provide tribute and soldiers to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

While there is still much work left to be done, our armies and peoples can finally rejoice at the unification of the Nile under [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"

An influential priestly caste runs the Temple of Philae as well as the surrounding regions, and both Ptolemaic Greek and Egyptian rulers in the past have made pilgrimages to the sacred Temple of Philae in the past.\n\nWith the restoration of the Temples of the Dodekaschoinos, the local priestly elite of the region has also thrived. The most notable of these is the Nubian priestly Wayekiye family. Furthermore, members of the Wayekiye family have entered our own court in Meroë swearing their allegiance - thus, our friendship with the Wayekiye shall allow us to use the Wayekiye family as an agent through which we can exert greater influence over the land and peoples of Dodekaschoinos, a region still contested between Rome and Meroë."

 mmetr_MEO_mission_events.7.desc: "Before our dynasty and since the first royal house of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, there have been thirty-two dynasties of Egypt, including the Ptolemaic and Argead dynasties of Ptolemy I Soter and Alexander the Great, respectively. Although Egypt had changed hands from the Greek Ptolemies to the Romans, unlike the Greeks the Roman Empire never claimed to be an official dynasty of Egypt. While the Roman emperors still sponsored and made offerings at the Egyptian temples, the sacred lands of Egypt were largely taken for granted and only made a province of the Roman Empire.\n\nWith the full annexation of Egypt, from the waters of the Nile to the Red Sea coast to the cities of Cyrenaica, we are the first Kushite dynasty since the Twenty-fifth Dynasty to rule Egypt. Thus, we have officially declared our [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty as the Thirty-third Dynasty of Egypt, the successors to a long line of rulers spanning over three millenia of human history. Though we have inherited by legacy, how we shall practically rule over the realm - and how much of the image and culture of the Egyptian pharaoh we wish to adopt - still remains undecided."

Like the Egyptians of old, we had mobilized a great expedition to the Land of Punt; unlike the Egyptians, this expedition was for conquest rather than trade, and we have now brought the rulers of Ethiopia to their knees. Even so, we have yet to find the definition source of goods such as myrrh and frankincense.

Most recently, there has been a dispute over the trade and possession of the ivory in the region.

The seed of silphium itself is in the shape of a heart, becoming a Greek symbol of love.

These ewers are especially valuable and are decorated with birds, beasts and other motifs. Great craftsmanship is required for the creation of just a single rock crystal ewer, as a high degree of skill is required to delicately hollow out raw rock crystals without breaking it while at the same time shaping the crystal into a fine design. These ewers are thus among the most valuable gifts that we can send to our friends beyond our borders, fine symbols of both our wealth and our generosity that shall continue to aid us in currying favor with courts across the world."

Although there are many in Egypt that were swayed to our side long before our conquest of Egypt thanks to our extensive spy networks, stability is not guaranteed.\n\nMany of the Egyptian elite are surely wary of any changes implemented by our regime - thus, we have allowed the local elites and personnel from the previous regime to remain in place under the supervision of a Fatimid vizier. We have also set up weekly sessions in the mazalim court to listen to and address the weekly grievances of the local populace.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, we have succeeded in gaining the trust of the Egyptian people.

However, the matter of administration in regard to such a large amount of land overseas is not an easy matter to address. Thus, there are many in our court who have proposed the idea of reorganizing our various vassals in Italy into a new title, the Emir of Italiya.\n\nWith the Emirate established, we would be able to entrust governance of Italy to an Emir who shall be loyal to our Caliph and our cause. To prevent the Emir from growing too powerful, however, we must consider how much land we wish to grant to the Emir of Italiya, or if we should grant any at all."

Although we have continued to emphasize our Alid descent and thus legitimacy to rule as Caliphs, the successors to the Prophet Muhammad, many of our rivals and non-believers refuse to refer to us as the Alid dynasty.

As a result, many of the cities of Epirus such as Arta and Ioannina became destinations for thousands of Greek refugees who fled the domains of our empire following the Fourth Crusade. With the Greeks in our own domains already doubtful of our intentions, the acquisition of Greek refugee lands now presents us with an opportunity to welcome back the Greek refugees while also making our decision clear as to whether they shall remain Greek or must become Latin."

Demetrio Progoni, the Prince of the Albanians and ruler of the Principality of Arbanon, had converted to Catholicism and made it a state religion, though he did so partly due to being threatened by Venice, as he feared Venice would claim its nominal lands in Albania from him.\n\nWith Roman Catholicism restored in Albania, perhaps the time has come to restore the Principality of Albania under a Catholic prince. We must also carefully consider our own political situation and stability, as granting only the lands immediately surrounding the religious and political center of Durrës as opposed to all of the Albanian lands may be a wiser move."

While the Bulgarians had warred constantly with the Greeks in Constantinople before our arrival, the Bulgarians had nonetheless adopted several aspects of Byzantine administration, allowing the Bulgarian tsar to rule over a fairly efficient state.\n\nThus, with the local rulers and structures of the Bulgarians still in place, we have the option of either maintaining the Bulgarian system, which would decrease the costs of administration, or directly integrating the Bulgarian lands into our imperial administration to limit Bulgarian autonomy."

These were the same ships that carried our Crusader brethren to the Holy Land and Constantinople.\n\nWith such notable designs already in place and in the hands of our Venetian allies, we have opted to commission Venetians in our empire for the construction of these fine Venetian ships, which now serve our interests in our our imperial navy separate from the Venetian Armada."

The Hagia Sophia has been further damaged since Justinian, with earthquakes and other natural wear-and-tear causing cracks in the main dome and other areas of the church.\n\nThus, we had taken it upon ourselves to restore the Hagia Sophia to its former glory, arguably perhaps even greater than before. At the same time, however, we can take it one step further - just as Constantine had removed the pagan statues from the ancient pagan temple that the Hagia Sophia was built upon, we could choose to remove all Orthodox traces of the Hagia Sophia and fully convert it into a Christian church. Or, we could keep the Orthodox aspects of the church so that the Hagia Sophia may be a shared space of worship for both Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians alike, which would also mean continued Orthodox pilgrims arriving in Constantinople."

As the seat of not only our royal Zunbil dynasty but also the location of the great Temple of Zun itself, it is understood by all of Zabul that the city of Zamindawar must be defended at all costs.

In Tokharistan, the Yabghus ruled over two hundred and twelve kingdoms, governors and prefects.\n\nWith the key cities of Tokharistan and their surrounding territories now under our firm control, we can call upon the various local rulers of Tokharistan to assist us in our wars against those who bring harm upon the followers of Zun."

Though we had broken from the Turk Shahis and established a safe haven for the followers of Zun, our capital in Zamindawar was always threatened by the Arab governors of Sistan and other ambitious invaders beyond Zabul.\n\nToday, however, our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] stands at the head of a great and mighty confederations of various tribes, kings, governors and prefects.

After much conflict, however, we have proven that Zun has deemed us worthy of His blessing, as the lands of Sistan are now firmly under the control of us Zunbils.\n\nWith the forces of Sistan utterly defeated, the humiliated governor of Sistan now kneels before our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], swearing his total fealty to the Zunbil dynasty.

Although the people of Gandhara have since rebuilt their cities, they never fully recovered from the devastation brought upon them by the Alchons, and the once thriving center of learning in Taxila was abandoned.\n\nWith the lands of Gandhara as well as its regional capital of Taxila under our control, the fate of the Gandhara heathens is now in our hands. If we wish, we can continue what the Alchons started and persecute the local heathens for the purpose of conversion.

Men of both local ethnicities as well as of Oghuz Turkic origin became rulers of their own realms, with the Zengid dynasty being a notable case of the latter group of emirs established in the wake of the Khwarezmid and Ayyubid incursions that drove the Seljuks into decline.\n\nAfter several grand campaigns, our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has subjugated these former atabeg dynasties, placing the emirs under the direct authority of Rûm. Like many other cases, conquest is only half of the equation - we must now determine how we shall integrate these local emirate dynasties.

The Armenians secured many trade agreements with the merchant cities of southern and western Europe, and the Armenian Cilician economy thrived.\n\nWith these very cities now under our control, the merchant class of Cilicia have mostly accepted our suzerainty and now work towards our own interests. While many Armenian families have decided to remain in Cilicia under our rule, thousands of wealthy Armenians have fled from Cilicia and settled in Cyprus.

Furthermore, the medreseler are attracting wise Islamic scholars from across the Islamic community and the world at large, and they also serve as intellectual centers for other subjects besides theology and faith such as medicine, mathematics and alchemy.\n\nThese projects are also part of our own Seljuk heritage - the very first of these medreseler were built by a Seljuk vizier, Nizam al-Mulk, in the lands of the Great Seljuks during the Seljuk dynasty's peak in Persia.

It is said that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was impressed to find so many cities on the western frontier, and was especially more keen to quickly set up a system of tribute and taxation.

Woven from silk with gold or silver threads, Lucca textiles are especially in high demand across the Mediterranean, its quality and prestige rivalling even the silks of the Byzantines.

On the other hand, there is another faction that favors the establishment of a Podestà, an office that would overshadow the consul - they hope that by allowing foreign individuals from outside of Pisa to become the Podestà, we would have a completely impartial leader who would not take sides in the bitter struggle between nobles, and merchants and artisans."

On the other hand, we could treat our former enemies instead as lifelong friends, granting them privileges in our league as well as some autonomy in exchange for their loyalty. Some of our more inflammatory Pisans are even advocating for the total humbling of the Fiorentinos, citing how the Romans burned and salted their rival city of Carthage... of course, we would not go to such extremes, though perhaps some disciplined pillaging would teach the Fiorentinos not to challenge us ever again..."

 mmetr_GOG_mission_events.4.desc: "The divine nature of our founder King Chumo's birth makes our own dynasty divine in nature - after the death of Hae Buru, king of Buyeo, his adopted son Geumwa ascended the throne. However, Geumwa came across a woman named Yuhwa who claimed to carry the child of Hae Buru himself. Geumwa had Yuhwa locked in a room - in the room, however, the sunlight followed Yuhwa wherever she walked, and she eventually gave birth to a large egg. Fearing what it could become, Geumwa gave the egg to animals but they refused to eat it; when he put the egg on the ground, animals walked around it and birds flocked to protect it; the egg could not be broken.\n\nThe egg hatched, and a boy was born from the egg. This boy would become known as Chumo, a nickname that described skilled archers. Chumo was placed in charge of the horses by Geumwa; Chumo intentionally fed the fastest horses the least food. Thus, when Geumwa went hunting, Chumo was given the thinner horse with fewer arrows - as a result, Chumo was unmatched in hunting due to riding the faster horses.\n\nThis, however, drew the ire of Geumwa's sons, who planned to have Chumo killed. Thus, Chumo fled from Buyeo and eventually established his own kingdom south of Buyeo, naming it Goguryeo, meaning 'High Castle.' With our forces now stronger than ever before, it is now time that we march against Buyeo and retake the throne from the illegitimate descendants of Geumwa."

Thus, the Buyeo court officials and some nobles have volunteered to travel to our capital of $CAPITAL_CITY$ and take residence there instead. On the other hand, we could persuade the nobles to remain in Buyeo and govern the lands on their own - this will allow us to levy more reliable and well-organized armies from the northern Buyeo frontier, led by Buyeo nobles and supported by their private soldiers, should we need additional manpower in wartime."

The offices in charge of the gun serve both military and civil roles.\n\nMost notably, the expansion of centralized administration has allowed for the uniform taxation of our subjects. We now impose a tax of five rolls of cloth, known as 'be', and five seok of grain on each household; an additional grain tax rate known as jo is also applied based on the relative wealth of each household. This allows us to collect revenue and supplies more efficiently from our subjects.\n\nFurthermore, a relief loan law known as jindaepeop has also been implemented"

However, the kingdom fell to the Han dynasty, and the heartland of Gojoseon was divided into Four Commanderies of Han under their new Han dynasty overlords.\n\nHowever, no empire lasts forever, and the weakness of the Han empire allowed us to retake the Four Commanderies from Chinese rule. With this conquest, however, we have also received several requests from Chinese refugees along the frontier who wish to settle in our lands in order to escape from the violence beyond our borders. Thus, we could accept their wishes so we consolidate our hold over our new territories in the immediate term; on the other hand, we could instead promote a policy of Korean resettlement in the former lands of Gojoseon, which will yield us slower yet longer-term results through the gradual assimilation of the lands into Goguryeo."

Officials and nobles from across the land, including those who had previously fiercely opposed us, have gathered in the capital in [Root.Capital.GetName] to witness the unprecedented ceremony and bow before the new Taewang. To etch this achievement in the annals of history, we have also erected a grand stele commemorating our Taewang's ascension to the newly-built Phoenix Throne of a united land. Thus, this marks a new era of a truly unified land and peoples in the region once known as the Samguk, or the 'Three Kingdoms.'\n\nWith these kingdoms now united, there have been talks of adopting the name Goryeo as the new official name of the state. While it is a name that has been used in the past, some Goguryeo officials believe that a new name will more effectively unite our new subjects under a more identifiable banner. Meaning 'High and Beautiful,' Goryeo would be a shortened version of our current name Goguryeo, which has the meaning 'High Castle'."

Andreas and his brother Peter were both originally fishermen by trade when Jesus Christ approached them, calling upon them to be Fisher of Men, meaning those who bring men to the Church and Jesus Christ.

The seed of silphium itself is in the shape of a heart, becoming a Greek symbol of love. Although access to silphium has become scarce over the generations, our efforts of developing the lands of Cyrenaica have provided new seedbeds from which we can produce the herb."

 uma_avert_a_second_fitna_mission_desc: "Although we Umayyads emerged victorious in the civil war of the First Fitna, it would be wise for us to take any means necessary to avoid a Second Fitna that will threaten the very existence of Umayyad rule in the Caliphate."
 uma_crush_the_revolution_mission_title: "Crush the Revolution"
 uma_crush_the_revolution_mission_desc: "There are many mawali, non-Arab followers of Islam, who resent the high status that Arabs and descendants of prestigious Arab tribes hold in Umayyad society. Thus, should any of them raise up arms against the Caliph, we must do all we can to crush their resistance."
 uma_legacy_of_uthman_mission_title: "Legacy of Uthman"
 uma_legacy_of_uthman_mission_desc: "The third Caliph of the Rashidun, Uthman, hailed from the Umayyad clan. He greatly expanded the Caliphate and established institutions still used by his descendants to this day; most importantly, his influence allowed for the rise of the Umayyad clan in becoming the permanant line of Caliphs in the realm. Thus, let us prove ourselves worthy successors of Uthman through our martial might."
 uma_push_back_the_romans_mission_title: "Push Back the Romans"
 uma_push_back_the_romans_mission_desc: "When the Islamic conquests began, the Rashidun Caliphs were backed by the full glorious power of God, completely conquering the mighty Persian Empire and taking much of the Romans' lands in the east. With our position in Syria and Egypt consolidated, let us continue our campaigns against the Romans and push them back from Anatolia."

 uma_besiege_al_qustantiniyya_mission_desc: "Constantinople has been the City of the World's Desire since the city of Byzantium's expansion and transformation into Constantinople by Emperor Constantine himself. Thus, let us prove to the Christian Romans our full backing from God by laying siege to the city of Constantine and taking their magnificent city from them."
 uma_caliph_of_rome_mission_title: "A Caliph of Romans"
 uma_caliph_of_rome_mission_desc: "The splendid Hagia Sophia built by the Roman emperors is an architectural and religious marvel. Thus, as common worshippers of God, it would only make sense for us to convert the Hagia Sophia into a great mosque worthy of receiving God's grace. Turning Constantinople into a distinctly Muslim and Arab city would also greatly help us in consolidating our position as the new holy leaders of our Roman subjects."
 uma_invasion_of_italy_mission_title: "Invasion of Italy"
 uma_invasion_of_italy_mission_desc: "With the city of Constantinople under full control of the Caliphate, and even converted to the true faith, we now have the preparations for conducting an invasion of Italy. As the spritual successor to the Romans as the undisputed holy leader under the one true God, it is time we take the Roman homeland to unite the Christian and Muslim spheres under the Caliphate once and for all."

 uma_people_of_god_united_mission_desc: "Our victory over the Romans and the Christian armies of the Franks have proven to all the superiority of our armies as well as the fact that God has chosen us as his true representatives and believers.

 egy_war_for_unification_mission_title: "War for Unification"
 egy_war_for_unification_mission_desc: "Saladin himself despised bloodshed unless it was absolutely necessary. One of the primary motives for Saladin's rise to power was the unification of Muslims against the common threat of the Christian Crusaders. The goal remains the same today, and we shall therefore raise our armies not for the purpose of spilling blood, but for the purpose of uniting the Muslim realm against the foreign invaders."
 egy_consolidate_hadramawt_mission_title: "Consolidate Hadramawt"
 egy_consolidate_hadramawt_mission_desc: "Saladin expanded towards southern Arabia and secured the lands of Yemen in order to gain control of the gate of entry for merchants ships entering the Red Sea, therefore profiting from the Red Sea trade. Let us consolidate our hold over southern Arabia by securing Hadramawt's loyalty to the Ayyubid kingdom."
 egy_red_sea_trade_mission_title: "Red Sea Investments"
 egy_red_sea_trade_mission_desc: "The Red Sea is a lucrative region for trade, being one of few links between India and the Mediterranean. Though Saladin established cordial trade relations with the Europeans, he never allowed them access to the Indian trade in the Red Sea, creating an Ayyubid monopoly of trade with India. Thus, let us continue profiting from the Red Sea trade by building facilities along the trade routes to direct merchants in the direction of the Red Sea, such as the trade stop of Yanbu in the Hejaz."

 egy_expand_into_nubia_mission_desc: "Hundreds of years ago, the Nubians of Makuria and the Muslim rulers of Egypt signed the Baqt treaty, ensuring peace between the Muslim world and the Christian lands of Nubia. However, the great threat of the Christian crusaders has backed us into a corner, and if we must expand in order to strengthen ourselves to face the foreign invaders, perhaps some honor must be discarded and the treaty annulled in order for us to consolidate our holdings in Upper Egypt..."
 egy_control_jerusalem_mission_title: "Control Jerusalem"
 egy_control_jerusalem_mission_desc: "Ever since the Christian's first holy war for Jerusalem, the city has been a hot point of contention between the Islamic and Christian powers. While the Christians launched their first crusade when the Islamic frontier was divided between the Sunni Seljuks and the Shiite Fatimids, we Ayyubids have overthrown the Fatimids and united the western coast under Sunni Islam. Thus, let us use this new Islamic unity to secure Jerusalem once and for all."

 egy_return_of_christians_mission_desc: "Saladin was well respected in both the Islamic and Christian worlds for his magnanimous treatment of Christian soldiers and civilians alike when warring with the crusaders.

 egy_reconquest_of_sicily_mission_desc: "The Muslim emirate of Sicily was conquered by the Normans over a century ago, and it has been under Christian rule ever since. With our expanded influence across the Mediterranean as well as our trade ties with European powers, perhaps now is a good time to retake the island, both as a strategic naval foothold as well as retribution for our Muslim brothers in Sicily."
 egy_defender_of_islam_mission_title: "Defender of Islam"
 egy_defender_of_islam_mission_desc: "Saladin rose to power in Egypt and expanded into Syria with the intention of uniting Islam against the Christian invaders. Thus, with the Abbasid Caliph's realm much smaller than it used to be, perhaps it is time for the Ayyubid family to take up the title of Defender of Islam."
 egy_unite_the_arab_states_mission_title: "Unite the Arab Clans"
 egy_unite_the_arab_states_mission_desc: "Since the Abbasid Caliphate declined in power, numerous independent dynasties emerged in the Arabian homeland, all vying for power in the vacuum left by the Abbasid decline.

 egy_restore_jerusalem_mission_title: "Restore Jerusalem"
 egy_restore_jerusalem_mission_desc: "The city of Jerusalem was home to many splendid works of architecture and art dating back to the Caliphates of the Rashidun and Umayyad before they were desecrated by the Christian invaders. With Jerusalem firmly secured and safe under our rule, let us restore the Muslim architecture and infrastructure of the holy city."
 egy_italian_merchants_mission_title: "Italian Merchants"
 egy_italian_merchants_mission_desc: "Though the Italian traders were allies with the crusaders in their invasions of our homeland, the Italian merchants have also made it clear that they are open to establishing friendly trade relations with us for our mutual benefit and profit. Thus, as we despise bloodshed, let us extend a hand in earnest friendship to the Italian merchants."

 egy_fealty_of_the_clans_mission_title: "Fealty of the Clans"
 egy_fealty_of_the_clans_mission_desc: "Saladin won the hearts of those he conquered by defeating them in battle and, instead of punishing them, freeing them from prison and even giving them gifts before sending them back to their realms to serve as Saladin’s subjects. Though they praised Saladin’s magnanimity, their descendants may not remember the kindness of us Ayyubids - even the Ayyubid households ruling domains across our lands may not remain loyal. Thus, let us take further steps in ensuring the clans serving as local rulers under our state do not forget this kindness and turn against us."

 egy_ally_the_assassins_mission_title: "Ally the Assassins"
 egy_ally_the_assassins_mission_desc: "The Nizari Isma'ili Assassins are a great threat to Muslim and Christian rulers alike in Syria. Though the Order of Assassins has been a constant threat to Ayyubid rulers since the dynasty's founding, the shadowy nature of the Assassins makes them very difficult and risky to eliminate without swift retaliation from the skilled Assassins. Thus, it may be mutually beneficial to instead seek common ground and form an alliance with the Assassins."

Although Saladin had overthrown the Fatimids and established a Sunni kingdom loyal to the Baghdad Caliph in its place, the legacy of the Shia Fatimids in Egypt remains. Thus, just as we had restored Sunni rule in Egypt, let us lead the misguided back into true believers of God."

As the first non-Caliph ruler to serve as protector of the two holiest sites in Islam, it is of great importance that we earn our title as Custodian and ensure the cities are safe for pilgrims from all around the world."
 egy_amir_al_hajj_mission_title: "Amir Al-Hajj"
 egy_amir_al_hajj_mission_desc: "Though the cities of Mecca and Medina are the destination of Hajj pilgrims from across the Islamic world, the devout are not safe from greedy and vile bandits who wish to target the vulnerable pilgrims.

 egy_defensive_fleet_mission_desc: "The vile crusader Reynauld of Chatillon outrageously dispatched a fleet to destroy and desecrate the holy sites of Mecca and Medina. Though the fleet was intercepted in the Red Sea by Saladin's forces, who knows when a contemptuous individual like Reynauld will attempt to target our holiest sites once more. Thus, let us establish a fleet for the purpose of defending the seas under our protection and bring further security to the true followers of God."

 egy_ayyubid_fortifications_mission_title: "Ayyubid Fortifications"
 egy_ayyubid_fortifications_mission_desc: "It must be admitted that we have learned much about the art of fortification from our enemies, the Crusaders and the Fatimids. We can strengthen the defenses of our realm using these designs, such as the Crusaders' curtain walls and the Fatimid's rounded towers with machicolations, openings for dropping projectiles on enemies from above."
 egy_sunni_madrasa_mission_title: "Sunni Madrasas"
 egy_sunni_madrasa_mission_desc: "As we continue to consolidate the position of Sunni Islam in Egypt and Syria, it is imperative that Islamic scholarship is allowed to flourish in peace once more after a long period of internal strife. Thus, let us build madrasas, religious institutions serving as schools of Islamic law. Although our ruler follows but one school of Islam, let us construct colleges from all four major schools of Sunni Islam so that all Sunni Muslims may feel welcome under our rule."

 egy_finish_off_east_seljuks_mission_desc: "The Seljuk sultans of Hamadan continue to rule in Persia to the east, far from their Anatolian counterparts of the Seljuk sultanate of Rum. Surrounded by the growing power of the Khwarezmians, perhaps it would be wise for us to preemptively seize the remaining Seljuk domains in Persia for the Abbasid Caliphate before they fall into the hands of other ambitious powers."
 egy_challenge_the_khwarezmids_mission_title: "Challenge Khwarezmids"
 egy_challenge_the_khwarezmids_mission_desc: "The Anushteginid dynasty of Khwarezmia has greatly expanded, seizing large quantities of land across Persia. We are certain that the ambitious Khwarezmids eye the Caliphate capital of Baghdad with hungry eyes. Thus, let us send our armies to challenge the Khwarezmids and protect the Caliph's borders in the east."
 egy_roman_alliance_mission_title: "Roman Alliance"
 egy_roman_alliance_mission_desc: "Though the Roman Empire in Constantinople is Christian like the crusaders who devastated our land and people, they are a different stock of Christian and have had many quarrels with the crusaders in the past. We have even heard reports of the crusaders attacking and sacking Roman cities in Anatolia and Greece. Thus, perhaps we may be able to establish goodwill with the Roman emperor and find a common enemy in the rampaging crusaders of the Franks."
 egy_ally_the_caliphate_mission_title: "Ally the Caliphate"
 egy_ally_the_caliphate_mission_desc: "Saladin emerged from obscurity and overthrew the Fatimid Caliph in Egypt with the purpose of establishing Sunni Islam in Egypt and serving the Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad. Thus, let us build a strong bond of rapport between subject and Caliph, and let us assure the Caliph that we hold no such ambitions of exerting influence over them like the Seljuks had not too long ago."
 egy_guardian_of_the_caliph_mission_title: "Guardian of the Caliph"
 egy_guardian_of_the_caliph_mission_desc: "Though the Abbasid Caliphate has recently regained some of the military power they held in Baghdad long ago, it is becoming clearer to all that it will be increasingly difficult for the Caliph to defend himself on his own as ambitious and powerful rulers rise all around Baghdad. Thus, perhaps it is time for us to formally place the Caliph in Baghdad under our protection, while still making it clear that we are the subjects and the Caliph is the leader of Islam."
 egy_expand_the_cairo_citadel_mission_title: "The Cairo Citadel"
 egy_expand_the_cairo_citadel_mission_desc: "The Citadel of Cairo was built by Saladin to defend the city from foreign invaders, whether they be Muslim or Christian, as well as protect the newly-established Sunni foothold in the formerly Shia Fatimid Egypt. Let us expand upon the citadel's foundations to defend our possessions and people in the heartland of Egypt."

 egy_subdue_the_zengids_mission_desc: "The Zengid dynasty in Mosul has had a complicated history with we Ayyubids, to say the least.

 egy_northern_dynasties_mission_desc: "The various Muslim dynasties to the north have had good relations with us in the past.

 egy_seljuks_of_rum_mission_desc: "We have served as mediators for the Seljuks of Rum in the past. Even so, their continued aggression against fellow Muslim states is concerning, as it could pose a major obstacle in the way of unity under the Ayyubid and Abbasid banners. Thus, perhaps it would be wise to compel the surrender of the Seljuk sultan."
 egy_first_roman_war_mission_title: "First Roman War"
 egy_first_roman_war_mission_desc: "Though we have never once warred with the Roman emperor in Constantinople, who seems to have little interest in seizing the holy lands of Jerusalem, perhaps a war with the Roman emperor is inevitable if we cannot agree to mutual friendship between our nations."

 ita_diplomats_to_constantinople_mission_desc: "The Germanic foederati leader Odoacer seized Ravenna, compelling the last Western Roman emperor Romulus Augustus to step down. However, this does not inherently make us an enemy of the Romans; by sending a diplomat representing the Senate, we can request for the Roman emperor in Constantinople to recognize the German ruler of Italy as the new governor and patrician of Italy. Such a move would ensure some level of peace between us and the Romans in Constantinople as well as refute the legitimacy of the Western Roman pretenders in Dalmatia."

Thus, the Ostrogoths pose a great threat to us due to their power base, their close proximity to our realm, and their connections of kinship with the powerful Visigoths in the west.

The people of Africa have been under Germanic rule for a very long time, as the Vandals had seized the province quite some time before the western empire fell. Thus, the transition of Vandal rule to the rule of a Germanic king in Italy should not be difficult for African residents; this means that we should be able to seize the breadbasket of Africa with little issue."

 ita_rebuild_the_eternal_city_mission_desc: "Though it has been long since the city of Rome could have been called a 'capital,' we must not underestimate the cultural and political legacy of the city of Rome. Thus, as a symbol of the stability restored to Italy, let us work on the restoration of the eternal city of Rome, where the founder king Romulus, the Scipios, Augustus and countless other great men stood many generations ago."

 ita_triumph_in_rome_mission_desc: "With our recent victories in Africa and elsewhere as well as the restoration of Rome, perhaps it is time for our victorious king to be given a Roman triumph by the Roman Senate, just as the consuls and emperors of old had been given in Rome long ago."
 ita_repair_the_viae_romanae_mission_title: "Repair the Viae Romanae"
 ita_repair_the_viae_romanae_mission_desc: "The Roman roads continue to be in use today despite the fall of the western empire, a testament to their quality. However, many of the roads have fallen into decay without any maintenance provided by a great imperial government. Thus, let us strive to restore these Roman roads to their former glory to boost commerce and travel in our realm."

 ita_appease_the_senate_mission_desc: "Though the Roman Senate is but a shell of its former self, they still hold much influence over how we shall be perceived by the Roman people. Thus, we must appease and win the hearts of these Senators in the capital so they may serve us as loyal advisors as well as spread word of our benevolence to all of the aristocrats and citizens of Italy."
 ita_improved_copper_coinage_mission_title: "Copper Coinage"
 ita_improved_copper_coinage_mission_desc: "As the Western Roman Empire declined, so did the quality of its coinage. Coinage is one way in which we can project our influence within and beyond our realm, spreading the face of our great ruler far and wide. Thus, let us establish a new system of copper coinage, with coins much larger and splendid than the puny coinage of the last emperors of West Rome."

 ita_chalcedonian_bishops_mission_desc: "Though our founder King Odoacer is an Arian Christian, he has already begun establishing strong and friendly relations with the Chalcedonian-majority bishops and Romans under our Arian German rule.

 ita_the_question_of_arianism_mission_title: "The Question of Arianism"
 ita_the_question_of_arianism_mission_desc: "Although most of the Germanic peoples in our realm, both nobles and soldiers alike, are followers of Arian Christianity, the vast majority of Romans in Italy follow the Chalcedonian doctrine established by the Roman Empire in the ecumenical council of Chalcedon. Thus, we now have the difficult question of which group to appeal to through our official religious declaration."

 sas_paygan_conscripts_mission_desc: "The majority of our infantry is composed of peasant conscripts known as the Paygan. Although their primary role is being fodder and thus have the lowest morale among our forces, they can function especially well and raise their morale by sticking together, serving as valuable assets during sieges. Paygan are also used for mining and excavation while not out on a campaign."

 sas_arabian_colonies_mission_desc: "Now that we have expanded our mining efforts in the heartland of our empire, we can now look beyond Iran and towards Arabia, where many mining and trade opportunities remain untapped by Sasanian administrators. Thus, let us establish Sasanian settlements in this neighboring region of ours, to enrich the treasury as well as our subjects in Arabia."

 sas_seize_the_silk_road_mission_desc: "When we defeated the last Parthian king, the Sassanid dynasty inherited their control over the Silk Road in Transoxiana. As we continue to prove ourselves better than the Parthians in every way, let us also show that our influence over the Silk Trade is far greater than any sort of influence the Parthians would have ever hoped to obtain."

 sas_chinese_trade_mission_desc: "We have heard of the riches of the far east, the land of the emperor of China from which our merchants acquire silk and other exotic goods that are worth even more in the west. Should we expand the influence our merchants have over the Chinese trade, perhaps we would acquire the opportunity to deal directly with the emperor of China himself."

 sas_win_mowbed_loyalty_mission_desc: "The Mowbed are the chief Zoroastrian priests of our realm, and the high priest holds an especially large amount of influence in the Persian court. Besides their religious role as priests and guardians of the fire temples, mowbeds also assist in the administration of the realm and handle legal matters between our subjects.

 sas_consolidate_eranshahr_mission_title: "Consolidate Eranshahr"
 sas_consolidate_eranshahr_mission_desc: "We have defeated the Parthians and restored Persian rule over the lands of what the Greeks call Persia, known to us in our own tongue as Eranshahr or Iranshahr.

 sas_ho_tohkshan_bod_mission_desc: "The head of the traders and merchants syndicate, the Ho Tokhshan Bod, is among the most important figures in the Sasanian royal court and bureaucracy. Directing the flow of trade in our empire, this individual is responsible for filling our coffers with profits made from the lucrative Indian and Chinese trade routes. Thus, let us work hard to make close allies among merchant class to win some favors from the syndicate."

 sas_sasanian_bureaucracy_mission_desc: "The Sasanian bureaucracy is made up of all of the privileged classes of our realm - the princely, noble, priestly and merchant castes.

 sas_expand_into_turan_mission_desc: "When the lands of the great king Fereydun were divided between his sons after his death, Iran and Turan emerged as two separate realms that would go on to become major rivals, with Iran eventually emerging victorious to become the undisputed rulers of the world. While the same Turya peoples no longer dwell in what we know as Turan, the various rulers of the east along our frontier continue to threaten our borders.

Once faithful Zoroastrians, the Osroenians have since turned to the rising religion of Christianity. Rule of the land had also changed hands from the Parthians to the Romans. As former Zoroastrian and Parthian land, it is our right to take back the lands of Osroene as servants the true faith of Ahura Mazda. Furthermore, pushing into the buffer lands of Osroene would be our first step in obtaining a foothold in the west for a full invasion of Syria in the near future."
 sas_persian_nobility_mission_title: "Persian Nobility"
 sas_persian_nobility_mission_desc: "Whether or not our nobility is loyal to us is a matter of life and death; the influential nobles, who command our armies, could murder our king and place someone of their own choosing on the throne. Besides the higher nobility, however, are the Deqhan, petty nobles who serve as imperial tax collectors and provincial administrators of the empire. If we do not win over all nobles, regardless of their power base, we shall never know true unity."
 sas_azadan_warrior_caste_mission_title: "Azadan Warriors"
 sas_azadan_warrior_caste_mission_desc: "The Azadan are the warrior caste of Sasanian society, made up of a minor freemen aristocracy living on small estates. These Azadan also make up the cavalry backbone of our armies; the most prestigious of the Azadan, the armored Asvaran cavalry, are often the ones who decide the outcomes of our battles. Thus, let us ensure that the Azadan will faithfully serve us as the famed Sasanian cavalry that strikes fear into the hearts of the Romans."

 sas_conquest_of_thrace_mission_desc: "To cement the conquest of the nigh-impenetrable fortress of Byzantium, we should secure Thracia, the western lands surrounding the city of Byzantium by land. Thracia was also a former territory of the Achaemenid Empire, which means that our conquest of the region would be both strategic as well as symbolic."

Although we do despise our former Parthian rivals, we cannot deny the splendor of their capital in Ctesiphon. Thus, let us continue where the Arsacids started and develop Ctesiphon into a capital far greater than anything they have ever achieved."
 sas_restore_the_royal_roads_mission_title: "Restore the Royal Roads"
 sas_restore_the_royal_roads_mission_desc: "Without well-patrolled roads, our postal and merchant caravans would be left to traverse the Silk Road on their own, vulnerable and in danger.

 sas_roman_war_preparations_mission_desc: "A great campaign against Rome for significant territorial gains will be costly; thus, it is imperative that we prepare our entire empire and mobilize all of our subjects of war, from the armored nobles who shall command the armies, to the freemen who shall provide manpower, taxes and trade income for the war effort."
 sas_conquest_of_syria_mission_title: "Conquest of Syria"
 sas_conquest_of_syria_mission_desc: "The lands of Syria have always been just within our grasp. The Parthians had failed to vanquish the Seleukid dynasty completely, allowing the Romans to enter Seleukid Syria and seize the land for themselves. Thus, let us make up for the Parthian's shortcomings and conquer the lands of Syria and at long last gain directly access to the Mediterranean Sea."

 sas_shah_of_all_shahs_mission_desc: "With the conquest of lands from Turan to Greece, we have truly established ourselves as worthy successors of the Achaemenids, and the Shah of all Shahs. Whereas Alexander's empire disintegrated in a few decades, the Achaemenid Empire lasted for over two centuries. Thus, let us ensure our rule's longevity is closer to that of our Persian forefathers and consolidate our hold over all corners of the empire."
 sas_shahanshah_mission_title: "Shahanshah"
 sas_shahanshah_mission_desc: "Our ruler's title 'Shahanshah' means 'King of Kings'. Also known by the ancient Mesopotamian title of 'King of the Four Corners of the World, the Shahanshah sits at the center of the world, the sun and moon revolving around him. Thus, let us prove to the world that we are indeed the King of Kings by subjugating all foreign kings who wish to defy our divine authority given to us by Ahura Mazda."
 sas_academy_of_gondishapur_mission_title: "Academy of Gondishapur"
 sas_academy_of_gondishapur_mission_desc: "There are several centers of learning in our empire, and the Academy of Gondishapur has grown into the most prestigious and decorated of these centers of learning. Thus, let us invest our state funds directly into the Academy and invite the finest scholarly minds from across the realm, whether they be Persian, Greek, or from any other foreign culture or religion."
 sas_sasanian_splendor_mission_title: "Khwarrah of the Shahanshah"
 sas_sasanian_splendor_mission_desc: "'Khwarrah' is the divine glory and splendor bestowed upon the kings chosen by Ahura Mazda as noted in the Avesta. Because kings are granted khwarrah based on their righteousness and piety, a king would also quickly lose the khwarrah should he ever become cruel and tyrranical, and another worthy king would be chosen and granted the khwarrah in his place. Our fortunes and the prosperity of our subjects has proven to all that we are the true holders of khwarrah; thus, let us work hard to prove to Ahura Mazda that we are deserving of the divine glory by continuining to grow the wealth and prosperity of our rule."

 sas_control_the_caucasus_mission_title: "Control the Caucasus"
 sas_control_the_caucasus_mission_desc: "The lands of the Caucasus are the ideal border for any rising empire. Easily defensible due to its natural geography, its great mountains and strategically-vital passes, we would greatly benefit from acquiring the Caucasus for ourselves. Additionally, the marzbans, frontier governors, of Sasanian lands are often granted special privileges so they may defend our borders loyally; should we seize the Caucasus, the marzban there shall surely receive only the most splendid of privileges - perhaps a golden throne?"
 sas_secure_palestine_mission_title: "Secure Palestina"
 sas_secure_palestine_mission_desc: "The lands of Palestine are our main gateway into the rich and prized lands of Egypt and the Nile. Thus, if we wish to restore the glory of the Persians and place Egypt under Persian rule once more, we will need to establish firm control over the lands of Syria Palaestina."
 sas_invasion_of_egypt_mission_title: "Invasion of Egypt"
 sas_invasion_of_egypt_mission_desc: "The lands of Egypt are Rome's second most productive breadbasket - before the Romans rebuilt Carthage, it had been their main source of grain. Such a rich and prosperous land would be wasted under the control of our Roman rivals. With the Syrian and Palestine coasts brought under Sasanian control, the time has now come to march south to Egypt and return the fertile lands of the Nile to Persian rule once more."
 sas_here_to_stay_mission_title: "Here to Stay"
 sas_here_to_stay_mission_desc: "The lands of Egypt have changed hands many times throughout the course of history, and it has been centuries since its people have known independence. They were subjugated by the Achaemenid Persian Empire; then, by the Hellenistic kings Alexander and Ptolemy; then, by the Romans. Now, they are under our direct rule. Thus, let us win the hearts of the Egyptians and show them that our ruling dynasty is here to stay in Egypt."
 van_sack_of_rome_mission_title: "Sack of Rome"
 van_sack_of_rome_mission_desc: "The eternal city of Rome has become a shadow of it former self; the fact that we Germans can so easily march across their lands is a testament of the Roman's decline.

 van_vandal_rule_in_hispalis_mission_desc: "Hispania is home to many riches, something that we Vandals are especially interested in obtaining. Thus, in these uncertain times, perhaps we would benefit from migrating towards a new home in the Roman provinciae of Hispania and claiming some of the more prosperous areas of the region for ourselves."
 van_carthago_nova_mission_title: "Carthago Nova"
 van_carthago_nova_mission_desc: "The city of Carthago Nova was a former center of the Carthaginians, inherited by the Romans following the Punic Wars. It continues to be a prominent trading city in Hispania, and is therefore the source of much of Hispania's wealth from commerce. Thus, let us seize the city itself to establish a trading position along the coast."
 van_rule_hispania_mission_title: "Rule Hispania"
 van_rule_hispania_mission_desc: "As the Roman's hold over its farther reaches of the empire continue to deteriorate, Hispania becomes increasingly ripe for the picking.

 van_mare_nostrum_mission_title: "Mare Nostrum"
 van_mare_nostrum_mission_desc: "To the Romans, the Mediterranean Sea is known as 'Mare Nostrum,' meaning 'Our Sea.' The Romans have long monopolized the Mediterranean and all of its shores, and it would be nothing less than humiliating for the Romans to lose what they have long and arrogantly called their very own sea - perhaps we shall be the ones to seize the Mediterranean for ourselves as our very own 'Mare Nostrum.'"
 van_arianism_triumphs_mission_title: "Arianism Triumphs"
 van_arianism_triumphs_mission_desc: "The ideas and doctrine of Arian were rejected and condemned as heresy by the Council of Nicaea, and we Arians continued to be looked down upon by the arrogant Romans. Thus, the triumph of the true doctrine of Arianism over the heretics that condemned us at Nicaea can only be achieved by spreading the doctrine far and wide beyond the lands of Germania."
 van_muster_vandal_levy_mission_title: "Muster the Vandal Levy"
 van_muster_vandal_levy_mission_desc: "We will need to deploy every Vandal man if we wish to carve a place for ourselves in a world dominated by empires.

 van_sortes_vandalorum_mission_title: "Sortes Vandalorum"
 van_sortes_vandalorum_mission_desc: "The sortes Vandalorum, or 'Vandal shares,' are lands divided up amongst the ruling Vandals in foreign lands that were once Roman.

 van_consolidate_sicily_mission_desc: "The island of Sicily is a vital naval base for consolidating our naval dominance in the western Mediterranean Sea. To ensure that no other great power, Roman or Germanic, shall challenge us in our local waters, it is imperative that all of Sicily is under our direct control and administration. It would also be wise to establish a stronghold on the island to secure our military presence in Sicily."
 van_invasion_of_italia_mission_title: "Invasion of Italia"
 van_invasion_of_italia_mission_desc: "With the island of Sicily now a core part of the Vandal kingdom, we have the foothold necessary for launching a great invasion into the mainland province of Italia. Although the Roman Empire is crumbling from both external and internal pressures, the cities of Italia are still valuable, and whoever reigns as King in Italy shall surely possess a great degree of prestige and influence in Mediterranean affairs."
 van_patrician_of_italia_mission_title: "Patrician of Italia"
 van_patrician_of_italia_mission_desc: "While we have never been on truly good terms with the Roman Emperor in Constantinople, they are still willing to recognize any non-Latin ruler in Italia as a proper Patrician of Italia if it means the extension of Roman influence in Italy. Thus, we would be able to acquire the status of patrician of Italia, a title that gives us much prestige and influence while making us only nominally, and not de facto, subject to the Roman Emperor in the east."
 van_empire_of_vandalia_mission_title: "Empire of Vandalia"
 van_empire_of_vandalia_mission_desc: "The Romans looked down on us, seeing us as no more than uncivilized barbarians while condemning our faith as heresy. With our rapid expansion across the former Roman provinces of the western Mediterranean, we have proven ourselves greater than what we have been labeled. No longer known simply for pillage and destruction, the name Vandal shall instead inspire both fear and admiration in peoples across the known world."
 van_african_migration_mission_title: "African Migration"
 van_african_migration_mission_desc: "With the invasion of enemies from the east and pressure from the Romans, we Vandals continue to search for a new home. The lands of the Roman province of Africa are bountiful, with the city of Carthago being the most bountiful breadbasket in all of the Roman Empire. Thus, the lands of Africa are an ideal destination for our migrating peoples."
 van_cultivate_african_grain_mission_title: "Cultivate the Breadbasket"
 van_cultivate_african_grain_mission_desc: "The cities of Africa and the breadbasket city of Carthage itself were damaged in our conquests. Furthermore, the local peoples of Africa are distrustful of our rule. Let us prove ourselves benevolent and capable rulers through the cultivation of Carthage and the surrounding province, developing the lands beyond what even the Romans could achieve."
 van_capture_carthago_mission_title: "Capture Carthago"
 van_capture_carthago_mission_desc: "The breadbasket of Carthage is vital for the Roman Empire, supplying its armies and peoples with an abundance of grain and foodstuffs. Cutting off this primary source of grain would deal a crushing blow to the Romans and grant us unprecedented influence over sea and trade. Now that we have migrated to the province of Africa, it is only a matter of time before the city of Carthage falls to the Vandals."

 van_mauro_roman_subjects_mission_desc: "The peoples of Mauretania were among the Roman subjects who resisted our incursions into Africa.

 van_control_mauretania_mission_desc: "The port cities of northern Mauretania are another valuable asset, serving as the checkpoint through which trade passes along the westernmost edges of the Mediterranean Sea. Let us therefore campaign into the lands of Atlas and capture the cities of Mauretania."
 van_subdue_the_mauri_mission_title: "Subdue the Mauri"
 van_subdue_the_mauri_mission_desc: "With the centers of Roman rule in Italy and Greece, the far western tribes of Mauretania were always just out of Roman control. With our capital in Africa, we have the position to fully subjugate the tribes of western Mauretania, which would grant us a very defensible position in the west and a valuable source of manpower in the form of Mauri auxiliaries."
 van_carthage_reborn_mission_title: "Carthage Reborn?"
 van_carthage_reborn_mission_desc: "The Carthaginians were Rome's most bitter rivals before their fall centuries ago, and stories of their bloody wars with the Romans are still told today. With the capture of the city of Carthage, our peoples more closely identify with the city. Some in our court have brought forth the idea of declaring ourselves as successors to the Carthaginians as a symbol of defiance against Roman rule. They argue that adopting a broader regional identity as a kingdom of 'Carthage' would allow our non-Germanic subjects in Africa to also more closely identify with the state, as opposed to a distinctly 'Vandal' kingdom."
 van_rex_vandalorum_et_alanorum_mission_title: "Rex Vandalorum"

Our official title is even 'King of the Vandals and the Alans,' emphasizing our attempts to integrate non-Vandals into one Germanic society. Thus, let us prove our intentions with our actions and consolidate our position as a growing Germanic power of many cultures."

 van_mighty_vandal_fleet_mission_desc: "If we wish to survive against the powerful armies of Rome, it would be best to prevent the Roman ships from reaching our shores so the Romans never have the opportunity to face us in the field. Thus, it would be in our best interest to build up a powerful navy unmatched by any power in the Mediterranean."

The Romans in the past had openly denounced piracy, yet secretly tolerated and even encouraged piracy along the shores of Cilicia as long as the pirates served their best interests and lined the pockets of Roman aristocrats. Thus, why should we be better than the Romans when such easy targets for pillaging lay vulnerable to us from across the sea?"

Upon ascension to the throne, monarchs are also expected to heed the advice, or 'redes', of the Witan council members, emphasizing the reciprocal dynamic between monarch and subject.

While Sunomata Castle was constructed in great haste thanks to its importance in the Siege of Inabayama Castle, a proper Toyotomi capital must require more time and resources. The site of the former Ikko-Ikki temple of Ishiyama Hongan-ji is very defensible, as proven by its defense against Oda Nobunaga.

 row_unite_the_twin_capitals_mission_desc: "The Roman Empire was split in two in order to more efficiently administer a vast empire such as ours, with two emperors ruling from two thrones in the east and the west. Although equals in practice, should the eastern emperor in Constantinople ever prove themselves incapable of rule, perhaps it would be best to reunite the twin capitals, Roma and Nova Roma, under a single Emperor once more."

While cooperation between the eastern and western Roman emperors is ideal, there may be a time in which the two emperors come into conflict. Thus, once war has begun between the two emperors, it could be said that the die has been cast, and that there is no turning back."
 row_rome_reunited_mission_title: "The Empire Reunited"
 row_rome_reunited_mission_desc: "The die had already been cast the moment we stepped foot into Constantinople, a blatant declaration of civil war against those who claim the Eastern throne.

Thus, let us dedicate ourselves to restoring our infrastructure, starting with our Roman roads, the blood vessels of the Roman Empire itself."
 row_bread_and_circuses_mission_title: "Bread and Circuses"
 row_bread_and_circuses_mission_desc: "In the past, 'bread and circuses' was a phrase used to criticize the common practice of the Roman Empire in sponsoring great games and circuses in order to distract the common people from the instability, corruption and other issues faced by the Romans. However, who is to say that it is not possible to have circuses while also having a stable and prosperous realm?"
 row_revitalize_the_economy_mission_title: "Revitalize the Economy"
 row_revitalize_the_economy_mission_desc: "The unrest faced by our state had caused a sharp decline in the economy of the Western Roman Empire. The value of Western Roman coinage, as well as the size and quality of the coins themselves, has seen a noticeable decline since coins from the golden eras of Rome. Thus, let us work hard to revitalize the economy, building up a great treasury and heeding the advice of only the most talented and well-versed in economics."

 row_question_of_arianism_mission_desc: "The doctrines of the heretic Arian were condemned by the Council of Nicaea. Even so, the heretical doctrine of Arianism has since seen widespread popularity, creating a great rift between fellow Christians across the empire. Thus, let us gather the most wise, pious and learned theologians across the empire and beyond to once more decide upon the question of Arianism and its place in our realm."
 row_romanization_of_the_east_mission_title: "Romanization of the East"
 row_romanization_of_the_east_mission_desc: "The lands of Dalmatia and Greece have been relatively slow to Romanize, especially with the Greeks maintaining their distinct cultural identity in their homeland. The Eastern Roman Empire has been greatly influenced by the Greeks, and critics of Romanization have claimed that Greek culture has defeated our own Roman culture in the east. Thus, let us put greater effort into assimilating the eastern peoples into the proper Roman identity."

 row_fund_the_war_machine_mission_desc: "Our armies have always been funded by the spoils of war. With our armies and borders now stretched across great spans of land and sea, it is no surprise that we find ourselves unable to expand much further beyond our established borders, leaving our treasury quite strained under the burden of imperial governance. Thus, rather than through direct conquest, let us continue to fund the Roman war machine through extracting tribute from the defeated."

 row_chi_rho_mission_desc: "In his struggle to reunite the Roman Empire, the great Emperor Constantine looked up and witnessed a divine vision, a great cross of light over the sun. Constantine and his soldiers all witnessed this vision, and by nightfall Constantine was visited by Christ Himself in a dream, who told Constantine to create a replica of the image in the sky, which Constantine carried with him to victory. Thus, the Chi Rho was born as a symbol of the glory of Christ, which guides us not only in times of peace as well as times of war."

And if the eastern Emperor in Constantinople should object to such a bold declaration, then so be it."

 row_roman_navy_reborn_mission_desc: "When the Roman Empire became the sole naval power of the Mediterranean, so much so the sea has been coined 'Mare Nostrum,' or 'Our Sea,' the navy no longer needed to maintain a peak fighting force. Mostly used for transporting troops and combating pirates, the naval capabilities of the Empire have seen a steep decline, hastened by the many internal crises faced by the Roman Empire. Thus, let us work hard to reestablish a navy of combat-ready warships, and thus regain the maritime traditions of old - the same traditions that had crushed the likes of Carthage and the successors of Alexander the Great."

Though it was a glorious battle that saw the birth of the Empire, it was the last major naval engagement in Roman history. With Mare Nostrum under full Roman control, the Roman navy, used only for combating piracy, began to decay as no naval power could stand up to the Empire's might. Thus, with our restored Roman navy, let us achieve glory on the seas once more."

Although the kings of the two lands have coordinated well to combat the Moors, we lack the uniting required to decisively drive out the heathens once and for all.

While they have enjoyed much autonomy, many privileges and exceptional degrees of favor from the Parthian royal family, the Suren house have also ventured beyond the lands of Parthia, establishing their own kingdoms in the east such as the Indo-Parthian kingdom. These Suren kingdoms are fully autonomous from the Parthian crown and could perhaps even one day challenge our hegemony in their respective regions; thus, it may be prudent for us to ensure they are subject to us while we can."
 prt_control_the_indus_mission_title: "Control the Indus"
 prt_control_the_indus_mission_desc: "The Indus River is a major natural barrier between the lands of Persia and those of India. Besides this fact, the naval opportunities that would result from controlling the Indus are also an incentive for leading a campaign to seize the river. We Parthians are quite limited navally, so the conquest of the great Indus River would grant us access to more ports for expanding our naval capabilities."
 prt_spices_of_india_mission_title: "Spices of India"
 prt_spices_of_india_mission_desc: "One of the most lucrative trades in the world is the spice trade, with most of the world's spices sourced from the eastern lands of India. Now that we have a foothold in India with the conquest of the Indus River, the namesake of India itself, let us acquire the loyalties of the eastern merchants and establish the Parthians as the new leaders of the spice trade."
 prt_client_king_in_pontus_mission_title: "Client King in Pontus"
 prt_client_king_in_pontus_mission_desc: "The kingdom of Pontus today is only a shell of its former self - the great kingdom of Mithridates VI the Great that once valiantly resisted against the Romans has been reduced to a Roman client state led by puppets to Roman interests. Let us liberate the peoples of Pontus and continue what Mithridates VI had started - first, we shall liberate Pontus; then, we shall liberate all of Anatolia, just as Mithridates had envisioned."

 prt_dominate_hellas_mission_title: "Dominate Hellas"
 prt_dominate_hellas_mission_desc: "The homeland of the Greeks fell to the Romans long ago, and today the Greeks are seen as among the core territories of the Roman Empire. Thus, seizing the lands of Greece from the Romans would serve as a crushing blow to the Roman Empire. Besides the strategic victory, we would also achieve a symbolic victory as successors of the Persian Empire and Hellenistic Empires by being the first of the Iranian powers to fully subjugate Greece once and for all."
 prt_hellenic_infantrymen_mission_title: "Hellenic Infantrymen"
 prt_hellenic_infantrymen_mission_desc: "While our great success against the Romans can be attributed to our formidable cavalry as well as our famed Parthian shot and other cavalry tactics, we would also benefit from a strong auxiliary force of infantry, especially as we advance further west into terrains that favor infantry. The Greeks have had a centuries-long legacy of powerful infantry, a heritage that even influenced how the Romans waged war."

 prt_parthian_heartland_mission_desc: "Before the Parthian kingdom, we Parthians were part of the Dahae Confederation. Although no longer unified, our cousin tribes of the former Dahae still reside in Parthian lands as well as lands to the north of Hyrcania. Thus, let us concentrate on consolidating the defenses of our Parthian homeland so we can secure our borders, acquire the various Dahae tribes' submission and reorganize the tribes into a proper client state of Parthia."

 prt_win_over_the_tribes_mission_title: "Win Over the Tribes"
 prt_win_over_the_tribes_mission_desc: "Besides the noble houses, our empire also relies on various nomadic tribes in campaigns. As many of these tribesmen learn how to ride on horseback before even learning how to walk, their cavalry are valuable auxiliaries in distant campaigns. Additionally, appeased tribes are much less likely to revolt and raid our frontier cities and settlements, and foreign tribes impressed or intimidated by our might shall be more likely to submit to Parthian hegemony."
 prt_influence_armenia_mission_title: "Influence Armenia"
 prt_influence_armenia_mission_desc: "The Kingdom of Armenia has long been contested between the Parthian and Roman Empires. We had even placed a branch of our ruling Arsacid dynasty on the Armenian throne to ensure their loyalty to our empire. Acting as a buffer zone between the two great powers, the rulers of Armenia should be made friends of the Parthian throne to ensure our interests are realized in the region."
 prt_greater_armenia_mission_title: "Greater Armenia"
 prt_greater_armenia_mission_desc: "Tigranes the Great of Armenia had established a great empire of his own, ruling over lands in Armenia, Cappadocia and Syria.

 prt_kushan_diplomacy_mission_desc: "Around the same time that the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia defeated the Seleukid Empire and conquered the lands of Media, Persia and Mesopotamia, further east the Hellenistic kingdom of Bactria was defeated by the tribes of the Yuezhi. Just as we have formed our own empire from tribal beginnings, in the east the Yuezhi have formed the Kushan Empire. Thus, we now have the question of whether we should deal with them"

 prt_sway_the_client_kings_mission_title: "Sway the Client Kings"
 prt_sway_the_client_kings_mission_desc: "We Parthians mostly care only for the conquest of territory; as a formerly nomadic peoples, we have little interest in directly ruling over the far reaches of our great empire. Thus, besides appointing nobles and members of the royal family to govern the domains of the empire, we have also entrusted various client kings such as those of Persis, Characene and Elymais to rule their respective territories in our stead. Thus, to ensure their loyalty to Parthia as well as keep the peace between Parthians and subjects, we should focus on winning over these client kings through diplomacy, gold and gifts."
 prt_annex_persis_mission_title: "Annex Persis"
 prt_annex_persis_mission_desc: "As we continue to become more and more Persianized, we view the heartlands of Persia with increasingly greater interest. When our forefathers first conquered the Frataraka of Persis from the control of the Hellenistic Seleukid Empire, a local king of Persia was appointed to rule Persis on our behalf. However, now that we have established ourselves as the proper heirs of the Achaemenid and Hellenistic legacies, perhaps we should take steps towards integrating the Persian heartland into Parthia proper."
 prt_adur_burzen_mihr_mission_title: "Adur Burzen-Mihr"
 prt_adur_burzen_mihr_mission_desc: "There are many holy fires across our empire, some of them dating back centuries beyond the time of the Achaemenid Empire itself. However, the most important flame of Parthia is located in Adur Burzen-Mihr. As the primary Zoroastrian fire of the Parthian royal family and people, it is imperative that we continue to kindle this flame and develop the surrounding city to ensure the prosperity and security of the holy fire's home."
 prt_appeal_to_the_magi_mission_title: "Appeal to the Magi"
 prt_appeal_to_the_magi_mission_desc: "The conquest of Persia and Media from the Seleukid Empire marked the return of Zoroastrian rule to these regions and peoples. Thus, let us continue to establish ourselves as the premier and undisputed leader of Zoroastrians in the world by heeding the sagely advice of the priestly class and spreading the faith across our empire, thus proving our piety to Ahuramazda."
 prt_silk_road_mission_title: "Silk Road"
 prt_silk_road_mission_desc: "The merchants and rulers of Sogdia have grown wealthy from the silk trade between China and the west. Serving as middlemen, the Sogdians are able to charge much higher prices for valuable goods such as silk, making great profits and therefore benefiting even more from the Silk Road than the Chinese merchants themselves. Should we subjugate Sogdia, we would be the new middlemen who shall reap the riches of the silk trade."
 prt_caucasian_tribute_mission_title: "Caucasian Tribute"
 prt_caucasian_tribute_mission_desc: "The Caucasian powers of Iberia have been a grounds for contention between the greater powers of Parthia and Rome for generations. Furthermore, the Alans and other nomadic tribes north of the Caucasus continue to use these defensible lands to raid our cities close by the range. Thus, let us win the favor of the kingdoms and tribes of the region to ensure the security of our northwestern holdings."
 prt_the_jade_gate_mission_title: "City of Hospitality"
 prt_the_jade_gate_mission_desc: "The oasis city of Kashgar is a gateway through which silk and other valuable trade goods from the far eastern lands of China pass to reach the lands of Sogdia, Persia and to western lands beyond. As a hospitable stop for traders from across the world, the city of Kashgar has become known to the Chinese as 'Shule' and in Sanskrit as 'Srikrirati,' meaning 'fortunate hospitality.' Should we secure control of Kashgar, we would exert even greater influence over the silk trade as wealthy middlemen between the Chinese and Mediterranean realms."
 prt_the_seven_great_houses_mission_title: "The Seven Great Houses"
 prt_the_seven_great_houses_mission_desc: "Besides the Parthian kings themselves, the Seven Great Houses of Parthia dominate Parthian politics and own several large estates across our empire. As our empire relies primarily on levies and cavalry from these noble families, it would be wise for us to ensure the seven houses remain loyal to us through whatever practical means necessary."
 prt_expand_the_realm_mission_title: "Expand the Realm"
 prt_expand_the_realm_mission_desc: "Though the nobles of the Seven Houses of Parthia are loyal to us now, they desire greater things just like any other common person. By expanding our empire, we would acquire new lands that we can grant to the noble families in exchange for their loyalty and guaranteed military contributions."
 prt_kindle_the_fires_mission_title: "Kindle the Fires"
 prt_kindle_the_fires_mission_desc: "We have been the only major Zoroastrian power since the great Achaemenid empire of Persia itself, as following the conquests of Alexander the Great the followers of Ahuramazda had fallen under primarily Hellenistic rule. Thus, let us prove our loyalty to Ahuramazda and continue kindling the holy fires across our empire."

 suk_the_first_thai_crown_mission_desc: "Having won independence from the crowns of the Mon and Khmer, we Thais of Sukhothai have established the first truly independent Thai kingdom. Thus, let us continue to consolidate our rule as the first Thai crown and ensure our kingdom shall last for future generations to come."
 suk_pho_khun_mission_title: "Pho Khun"
 suk_pho_khun_mission_desc: "Rather than viewing us as a divine ruler like a Devaraja, we wish for our fellow Thai subjects to look upon us as father figure who shall lend a benevolent and guiding hand to them in times of peace as well as in times of trouble. Thus, our ruler is known as Pho Khun, meaning 'father,' to emphasize this paternal relationship with our subjects. While there are certainly benefits to a divine, autocratic system of rule, earning the respect and love of our subjects shall result in loyalty that is not as easily broken by avarice or doubt."
 suk_royal_elephants_mission_title: "Royal Elephants"
 suk_royal_elephants_mission_desc: "We Thais have built up a relationship with our elephants over the course of generations; our royal family itself has many elephants of its own. The elephants help us with daily life in times of peace and accompany our armies in times of war. As elephants are thus an invaluable asset to Sukhothai and the Thai people, we must continue to raise strong war elephants who shall bring peace and security to our kingdom."
 suk_expand_the_mandala_mission_title: "Expand the Mandala"
 suk_expand_the_mandala_mission_desc: "Our capital city of Sukhothai relies on the mandala system to rule the vast territories beyond our city limits. Meaning 'circle' in Sanskrit and symbolizing the universe itself, the mandala involves various city-states answering to a single overlord. In our kingdom, the city of Sukhothai maintains its authority over various local rulers of mueang, or cities, subject to our rule. In exchange for protection, these cities provide tribute and manpower. Thus, let us continue to expand our mandala and acquire new subjects who shall serve us loyally for generations."
 suk_secure_tribute_mission_title: "Secure Tribute"
 suk_secure_tribute_mission_desc: "Our control over the various mueang who have military obligations would be difficult to maintain should we ever grow too large and unstable; the death of a king, no matter how loved or hated, would be enough to throw various mueang into open defiance and rebellion. Thus, let us establish many tributaries without military obligations to expand our influence without straining the net of control we have over our subjects."
 suk_contest_the_cham_mission_title: "Contest the Cham"
 suk_contest_the_cham_mission_desc: "The people of Champa are among the various independent polities who rule the lands of Southeast Asia. Known for their seafaring capabilities as well as their lucrative trade networks across the region, from seas of southern China to the Indian Ocean. Thus, we would benefit greatly if the Cham people were loyal subjects of ours."
 suk_viet_diplomacy_mission_title: "Viet Diplomacy"
 suk_viet_diplomacy_mission_desc: "The Viet peoples are separated from us Thais by a vast mountain range that is not easily passable. Before we commit our forces to a risky campaign across these mountains, we must first consider whether we should take a diplomatic approach with the people of Dai Viet."
 suk_imperial_ambitions_mission_title: "Imperial Ambitions"
 suk_imperial_ambitions_mission_desc: "Having toppled the once great Khmer Empire and gained entry to the lands of the Viet peoples, we suddenly have obtained new and greater ambitions, ones which our forefathers would never have even dared to dream. Thus, let us reach north and seize the Mandate of Heaven itself, just as the Mongols had done to the Song, and establish a Thai dynasty in the Middle Kingdom!"
 suk_a_thai_silk_road_mission_title: "A Thai Silk Road"
 suk_a_thai_silk_road_mission_desc: "Having claimed the throne of the Heaven in the Middle Kingdom, we now have the opportunity to establish Thai control of the Silk Road itself. Thus, let us export both Chinese and Thai silk to the west so we may bring wealth, security and prosperity to both our Thai and Chinese subjects alike."
 suk_control_the_mae_nam_mission_title: "Mae Nam"
 suk_control_the_mae_nam_mission_desc: "The Chao Phraya River is one of many rivers, known in Thai as 'mae nam,' or 'mother of waters.' However, this major river is especially vital, as it not only supplies us our harvests but also serves as the central trading hub for the region. Thus, securing the Mae Nam and its trading posts will greatly benefit our country and people by giving us greater access to open seas trade and promoting internal trade between the mueang of our kingdom."
 suk_thai_silk_mission_title: "Thai Silk"
 suk_thai_silk_mission_desc: "Unlike other regions in the world, our silk is not entirely imported from the lands of China; instead, we grow and raise our own silkworms and weave our own silk. Although we mostly produce Thai silk for personal use, we have never truly attempted marketing and exporting Thai silk abroad. Thus, let us begin the trade of silk to neighboring lands, like those of the Khmer and Malay, and perhaps even India itself."
 suk_unite_the_mueang_mission_title: "Unite the Mueang"
 suk_unite_the_mueang_mission_desc: "The mandala system functions only if the various mueang, or city-states, subject to the city of Sukhothai remain loyal and steadfast. Many of the ruling dynasties of these mueang also exert a great degree of influence in the politics of the capital of Sukhothai as well as the kingdom as a whole. Thus, let us appease the mueang and promote greater unity by addressing the advice and complaints of the various local rulers under Sukhothai."
 suk_challenge_the_empire_mission_title: "Challenge the Empire"
 suk_challenge_the_empire_mission_desc: "Our kingdom of Sukhothai was born when the mueang, or city-state, or Sukhothai broke free from the grasp of the Khmer Empire and declared and independent, Thai kingdom in Sukhothai. As we continue to grow our power and subjugate the various mueang surrounding Sukhothai, including both Thais and non-Thais alike, we would amass enough power and influence to challenge our former overlords, the Khmer Empire itself."

 suk_hegemonize_the_khmer_mission_desc: "With the key city of Angkor taken by our forces, we have inflicted great damage to the morale and martial capacity of the Khmer Empire.

 suk_control_the_spice_trade_mission_desc: "Now that we control Malacca, we have greater access to rich, new markets far beyond the lands of Sukhothai, including the lucrative spice trade of the southern seas. We should secure additional entrepots around the Straits of Malacca to assert our dominance of the spice trade."
 suk_cultivate_sukhothai_mission_title: "Cultivate Sukhothai"
 suk_cultivate_sukhothai_mission_desc: "In the mandala system, our kingdom is more of a collection of city-states, or mueang, which all answer to a single supreme city state, ours being the capital city of Sukhothai. Thus, our legitimacy and power projection over our subjects and tributaries is only as great as our city itself. Thus, let us develop our city into a grand mueang that shall be both respected and admired by peoples across the realm, including both those subject to us as well as those far beyond our kingdom’s borders."
 suk_chinese_diplomacy_mission_title: "Chinese Diplomacy"
 suk_chinese_diplomacy_mission_desc: "Now that we have cultivated Sukhothai into a grand city of the Thai people, we have earned the prestige to receive the recognition of larger powers beyond our domain.

 suk_rule_the_tanao_si_mission_desc: "The mountain range of Tanao Si serves as a natural barrier between the land of the Thais and the lands of the Burmese.

 suk_secure_malacca_ports_mission_title: "Secure Malacca Ports"
 suk_secure_malacca_ports_mission_desc: "The ports of Malacca serve as a key trading point between the riches of China and India.

Thus, let us use our martial might to open great opportunities for the Thai people!"

 suk_a_grand_thai_navy_mission_desc: "We have never been a true naval power, instead being eclipsed by those with grander fleets such as the rulers of Malaya and Java.

 suk_thai_liberation_mission_title: "Thai Liberation"
 suk_thai_liberation_mission_desc: "The birth of the Sukhothai kingdom was one of liberation - we Tai peoples migrated south from our ancestral homeland and settled in various cities and villages across the realm, including the city of Sukhothai. Though first under the rule of Khmer and Mon monarchs, our capital city of Sukhothai led a successful rebellion against our overlords and established its own fine kingdom in the lands of Suvarnabhumi."

 suk_march_to_lopburi_mission_desc: "One of the kingdoms that was negatively impacted by the rise of our Thai kingdom is the kingdom of Lavo, known in the Thai tongue as Lopburi. They currently control the key city of Ayodhaya as well as the heartland of the vital Chao Phraya river. Thus, let us continue our expansions and bring all of the lands of Lopburi under Thai rule once and for all."
 suk_mon_tribute_mission_title: "Mon Tribute"
 suk_mon_tribute_mission_desc: "The peoples of the Mon were once the rulers of the lands of Sukhothai and the surrounding region. However, the expansion of the Khmer Empire as well as the rise of Thai and Burmese kingdoms such as our own were detrimental to the Mon. Now, only a few Mon polities remain. Thus, let us acquire their tribute through war and diplomacy and establish ourselves as protectors rather than invaders."
 suk_burmese_opposition_mission_title: "Burmese Opposition"
 suk_burmese_opposition_mission_desc: "The Burmese kingdom of Pagan was one of may threats that challenged our regional hegemony in the lands of the Thais. However, the Pagan kingdom is long past its height in prosperity and martial might - let us take advantage of the decline and fragmentation of the once great Pagan kingdom and lead a campaign against the Burmese remnants to secure the Burmese heartland firmly under the mandala of Sukhothai."
 suk_launggyet_kingdom_mission_title: "Launggyet Kingdom"
 suk_launggyet_kingdom_mission_desc: "The Arakanese peoples centered in Launggyet had enjoyed independence from the Burmese rulers of the Pagan kingdom due to various geographic and political factors. The home to a naval tradition not shared by any of the Burmese peoples, the Arakanese engage in both trade and piracy. Thus, we would have much to learn from them if we wish to establish our own naval power and access Indian markets - such knowledge can be obtained through conquest or diplomacy."
 suk_bengal_campaign_mission_title: "Bengal Campaign"
 suk_bengal_campaign_mission_desc: "Thanks to establishing our influence in Arakan, we now have greater access to the rich and lucrative markets of India to the west. While Arakan is an eager ally of ours, there are other powers who may contest our influence along the Arakanese coast. One such power is the ruler of Bengal, as the Bengali kings had influenced Arakan for generations. Thus, let us contest the Bengalis and expand our mandala towards the heartland of India for the first time in Thai history."

 suk_sponsor_thai_wat_mission_desc: "There are many Buddhist temples across the land, from the birthplace of the Lord Buddha himself in Lumbini and the Theravada haven island of Lanka to our west, to the great cities of the Khmer Empire to our east.

 suk_land_of_gold_mission_title: "Land of Gold"
 suk_land_of_gold_mission_desc: "Many kingdoms in history have claimed to be successors of the mysterious Suvarnabhumi, meaning Land of Gold in Sanskrit. A rich land that traded with India and Rome alike, its legacy would surely greatly increase the prestige of any polity that can prove themselves its successor. Thus, let us enrich ourselves gold to ensure the security and well-being of our subjects, as well as enrich ourselves spiritually to ensure we and all of our subjects walk a virtuous and righteous path along the Middle Way."

 suk_xieng_dong_xieng_thong_mission_desc: "The city of Xieng Dong Xieng Thong is also inhabited by many of the Lao people, who are fellow Tais who share linguistic and cultural similarities with us Thais of Sukhothai. When we rebelled against Khmer and Lavo control, the city of Xieng Dong Xieng Thong was one of many Tai city-states that benefited from our revolution. Thus, to ensure they remain safe from foreign influence, let us incorporate the cities of the Lao people into our mandala."

 suk_tais_of_the_shan_mission_desc: "The Tai peoples of the Shan Hills also migrated south from the Tai homeland, thus sharing common ancestry and culture with us Thais of Sukhothai. The name of the Shan itself is a Burmese version of the word Siam, which originates from Siem, the term that we Tais were called by the Khmer Empire.

 aks_colonize_socotra_mission_desc: "The island of Socotra stands in the center of the Erythraean Sea at the crossroads of trade between the lands of Africa, India, Arabia and the Mediterranean. Inscriptions from travelers and merchants across the world have been left on the island, including inscriptions in the Indian Brahmi, Palmyrene, Greek, Bactrian, South Arabian and Ethiopic scripts. Thus, directly settling this island of Socotra and establishing it as a trading port would be beneficial for our growing trade empire."

The land and these peoples have direct access to the sea, more specifically access to waters shared with the neighboring lands of India.

However, as we continue to expand further and further east towards the lands of Egypt and Syria, we have found that relying solely on the Kutama is not enough. Thus, we have begun recruiting Turkish ghulam, slave soldiers who serve as our infantry while the Kutama serve as our cavalry. These ghulam have quickly occupied high positions in the state, serving as prominent generals, officials governors - thus, it is important for us to keep these Ghulam loyal to our righteous and holy cause."

As a result, we have made it so any individual of talent can ascend the ranks of our government regardless of their religion. Let us therefore continue to seek talent from the dhimmi of our lands and establish a true meritocracy."

Other cash crops of Egypt include cotton and sugar cane. Since the rule of the Tulunid dynasty of Egypt, however, grain has been overtaken by flax as the main cash crop of the region. Flax, from which linen fibers for Fatimid textiles are made, has allowed for the expanded export of linen, a trade that now drives the entire Egyptian economy. Besides the export of flax, flax also has high local demand, as textiles produced in Fatimid Egypt are among the finest in all of the world, and production centers of Fatimid textiles are of worldwide renown."
 fat_kutama_berbers_mission_title: "Call Upon the Kutama"
 fat_kutama_berbers_mission_desc: "The Kutama Berbers have always been an important part of the Fatimid army since before our Caliphate was officially declared. It was the Kutama who converted to Isma'ilism and supported our founder, Caliph Abd Allah al-Mahdi Billah, making up the bulk of the army that destroyed the Aghlabid emirate and thus allowed the Fatimid Caliphate to establish its base in Ifriqiyah. Since then, the Kutama have become an elite within our army and government. It would be therefore wise to call upon these brave and devout warriors once more to support our Caliph on the battlefield."
 fat_makurian_relations_mission_title: "Makurian Relations"
 fat_makurian_relations_mission_desc: "Due to our religious beliefs being significantly different from the majority-Sunni Islamic World, there are few potential allies for us in the Muslim world. Thus, in the past our Caliph instead turned south to the Christian Nubians of Makuria and established long-lasting peace and cooperation with the kingdom of Makuria. Our armies also depend on this relationship, as slaves provided by Makuria are used to man the Fatimid army. Us two powers also engage in other trades, as we export wheat, wine, and linen to the Nubians while importing ivory, cattle, ostrich feathers and slaves from Makuria."
 fat_spread_the_dawa_mission_title: "Spread the Da'wa"
 fat_spread_the_dawa_mission_desc: "The Da'wa, the doctrine of Isma'ili branch of Shia Islam, is the primary doctrine of our state. Although we Fatimids have always practiced a policy of religious tolerance towards both Sunni and Dhimmi, we shall always pursue our initial goal of spreading the true doctrine among the world. Although we have established an organization structured specifically for the promotion of Isma'ili doctrine, the majority of the people of Egypt continue to stick to their Sunni beliefs. It is therefore imperative that we continue our holy path and enlighten our subjects of the true doctrine of Islam."

 fat_custodian_of_the_holy_cities_mission_desc: "The holy cities of Mecca and Medina are of great significance to Islam, and countless devout Muslims embark on the pilgrimage to the holy cities and the Kaaba in Mecca every year. These pilgrims and holy sites of Hejaz, however, are not safe from harm. Thus, let us bring Mecca and Medina as well as the surrounding territories under our protection."

 fat_arabian_expansion_mission_desc: "The states of Yemen have benefited from the lucrative trade with India, Africa, Persia and the Mediterranean for centuries. However, the people of Yemen have not known unity and stability since the time of the Himyarites, predating the spread of Islam in Yemen. Thus, let us restore prosperity and stability in Yemen by placing them under our direct control and protection."

 fat_subdue_the_qarmatians_mission_desc: "Although the Qarmatians are Isma'ili Shia Muslims like us, they rejected our Caliph as the true imam. As if rejecting our Imam-Caliph is not enough of an insult, the insolent Qarmatians continue to harass and raid our towns and cities as well as target pilgrims traveling to holy sites. Let us therefore put them in their place and remind them that our Caliphate is not to be defied."
 fat_legacy_of_the_first_imam_mission_title: "Legacy of the First Imam"
 fat_legacy_of_the_first_imam_mission_desc: "Our dynasty of Caliphs is directly descended from Imam Ali, the first Imam of the Shia faith, and his wife Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad. It is through this lineage that we are able to rightfully claim the title of Caliph. Although we have always referred to ourselves as the Alid dynasty, our rivals as well as hostile Sunnis and other non-believers refuse to recognize our legitimacy. If we have to lead our revolution to restore the borders of the Caliphate under Ali, none shall remain to question our claim to the Caliphate."

We have therefore promoted our Isma'ili Shia doctrine among our subjects and neighboring lands beyond our Caliphate's borders. However, our Isma'ili currently lacks a single legal code that all of the Fatimid peoples can rely upon for maintaining piety and order in the Caliphate. Thus, it may be wise to heed the wise words of the jurists of our empire so we may compile a proper written legal code for our one true doctrine."

Thus, let us take our first step towards our ambitions and take control of the key cities of Alexandria and Fustat in Egypt."
 fat_imam_caliph_of_egypt_mission_title: "Imam-Caliph of Egypt"
 fat_imam_caliph_of_egypt_mission_desc: "Our ruler is known as the Imam-Caliph, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is both the Imam, the infallible leader of the Shia Muslims, as well as the Caliph, the successor of Muhammad and the leader of the entire Islamic community. However, most of the population of Egypt is Sunni and does not recognize our ruler as the true Imam-Caliph, at least not truthfully in their hearts. It is therefore imperative that we promote the true doctrine among the peoples of Egypt."

 fat_hegemon_of_syria_mission_desc: "The thriving lands and cities of Syria are the stepping stone from which we can launch an invasion into the lands of the Tigris and Euphrates and therefore complete our goal of seizing Baghdad from the false Caliphs. We have bided our time and built up our forces, incorporating loyal Kutama Berbers and ghulam alike in preparation for the campaign into Syria.

The mosques' grandeur diplays to all the wealth and prosperity of the empire, and their elegance and beautifully-constructed features also serve a testament to the religious devotion of the Caliph and his subjects. Furthermore, Fatimid mosques are renowned for having greater complexity in design compared to mosques built by other dynasties in the Islamic World, and as a result Fatimid architecture and art has become prestigious on the world stage."

 fat_patron_of_the_arts_mission_desc: "Fatimid art is renowned across the world for its exquisite quality of both craftsmanship and materials. The prosperity of our Caliphate has furthermore triggered prosperity among the upper classes of Fatimid society, leading to increased patronage of the arts and the creation of opulent and fine objects such as carved rock crystals, lustreware ceramics, wood and ivory carvings, good jewelry, textiles and decorated books.

As a city built by the Fatimid dynasty itself, it is imperative that we develop al-Qahira into a beacon of prosperity that is unparalleled by any city in the Islamic World - as a new city built by our own hands, the city’s status shall reflect upon our own greatness."

The mosque does not serve solely religious purposes, however, as the al-Azhar Mosque has expanded into a center of learning that is notable in not just Egypt but also the entire the Islamic World. Furthermore, the mosque plays a significant role in preserving the legacy of the Fatimids, as the mosque is named after 'az-Zahra,' meaning 'the Shining One,' the title given to Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad from whom we are descended. Let us therefore expand the Mosque into a religious and intellectual complex by adding a library with thousands of manuscripts and refurbishments such as domes, arches and minarets."

However, our cousins the Alchon Huns devastated the city, burning down its Buddhist monasteries and stupas, and the university was abandoned after the Alchon Huns' fall.

 rum_control_syria_mission_desc: "Syria was once one of many administrative divisions of the Great Seljuk Empire - however, today the lands of Syria have been lost to local dynasties, and Seljuk influence no longer spans across the region. As one of the last Seljuk dynasts, we Seljuks of Rum shall march upon Syria and retake its lands for ourselves."
 rum_end_to_the_crusades_mission_title: "An End to the Crusades"
 rum_end_to_the_crusades_mission_desc: "The holy land of the Levant and the city of Jerusalem were once in the firm control of the Seljuk dynasty before the Christians in the west declared a holy war and seized the Levant in their so-called 'crusade,' massacring many of our fellow Muslims in the region. Now that we have established a foothold in Syria, we have the opportunity to defeat the crusaders and reclaim the Levant in a just war of reconquest and retribution."
 rum_egyptian_campaign_mission_title: "Egyptian Campaign"
 rum_egyptian_campaign_mission_desc: "When we Seljuks tore across the lands of Persia and Mesopotamia, the Fatimids of Egypt were in decline. Although we had intended to ally with the Fatimids of Egypt against the crusaders, negotiations broke down, and now both the Levant and Persia have been lost. With the Levant retaken, perhaps Egypt shall only cooperate with us if we seize its lands and peoples by force."
 rum_consolidate_cairo_mission_title: "Consolidate Cairo"
 rum_consolidate_cairo_mission_desc: "Although we have taken Egypt by force, we will never know true stability in Egypt until we consolidate our position in the regional center of Cairo. Thus, let us place a capable atabeg in Cairo and assist them in returning stability and prosperity to the land and people."
 rum_caravanserais_mission_title: "Caravanserais"
 rum_caravanserais_mission_desc: "The caravanserais of our realm serve as a vital part of Anatolian trade between our Sultanate of Rum and the world beyond our borders. While the caravanserais are used as trading posts, they also serve to defend caravans as well as allow information about foreign realms to pass into our hands. Due to their importance, the caravanserais have become notable landmarks in our realm."
 rum_roman_riches_mission_title: "Roman Riches"
 rum_roman_riches_mission_desc: "Now that we rule as Sultans in the Land of the Romans, it is only right that we also enjoy the economic prosperity and exotic riches once held by the once-mighty Roman Emperor in Constantinople. As we expand our political and economic sphere in Anatolia and the adjacent seas, our coffers shall become noticeably fuller than ever before, and thus our subjects shall also prosper."
 rum_armenians_of_cilicia_mission_title: "Armenians of Cilicia"
 rum_armenians_of_cilicia_mission_desc: "The Armenian kingdom of Cilicia has opposed us for many years, defying both Byzantine and Seljuk rulers alike. The kingdom has entrenched itself in Cilicia and consolidated its military and economic presence in the region. Thus, it will take some effort to fully conquer Cilicia and its cities; however, with Cilicia being a major crossroads of trade, the economic spoils of such conquest would be well worth our efforts."
 rum_besiege_aleppo_mission_title: "Besiege Aleppo"
 rum_besiege_aleppo_mission_desc: "The founder of the Sultanate of Rûm, Suleiman ibn Qutalmish, had attempted to besiege the city of Aleppo in hopes of seizing Syria from the Seljuk emir of Syria, Tutush I. In the ensuing battle, however, Suleiman was killed, and Suleiman's son Kilij Arslan were surrendered to Tutush. Fortunately, Kilij Arslan was able to reestablish the Sultanate of Rûm less than a decade later. With Cilicia secured, we now have the foothold from which we can avenge the death of Suleiman and seize the city of Aleppo as a stepping stone for further expansion in Syria and beyond."
 rum_iranian_ambitions_mission_title: "Iranian Ambitions"
 rum_iranian_ambitions_mission_desc: "The existence of our Sultanate of Rum as the last significant Seljuk power could only result from the collapse of Seljuk authority in Persia. Even in Anatolia, we have carried with us many Persian traditions and even Persian names. Thus, should we ever return to Persia as true Seljuk dynasts, it would be the symbolic first step towards the restoration of the Great Seljuks in the lands of Iran."
 rum_bulwark_of_islam_mission_title: "Bulwark of Islam"
 rum_bulwark_of_islam_mission_desc: "As a Muslim state surrounded by Christian rivals, we Seljuks of Rum are the bulwark of Islam, the last protectors of the Muslims in eastern Europe following the fragmentation of the Seljuk realm in Anatolia. It is therefore imperative that we strengthen our military and protect our borders not only for the survival of the Seljuk dynasty but also for the survival of the Islamic communities west of Syria."
 rum_march_to_baghdad_mission_title: "Long March to Baghdad"
 rum_march_to_baghdad_mission_desc: "One of the most notable events of the Great Seljuk dynasty was the acquisition of Baghdad and the Caliphate. However, with the Khwarezmid invasion and the restoration of Abbasid autonomy in Iraq, the city fell out of Seljuk hands. As we advance on our long march west, the grand city of Baghdad is one key city that we must retake for the restoration of Seljuk authority in Iraq."
 rum_seljuk_restoration_mission_title: "Seljuk Restoration"
 rum_seljuk_restoration_mission_desc: "Our relatively rapid rise to power in Persia has allowed our once-distant dreams of restoring the Great Seljuk Empire in Persia to now be within our grasp. With the momentum of conquest and the blessings of God on our side, let us reach for our dreams and tear across Persia with the famed Seljuk cavalry in the vanguard."
 rum_new_emirs_in_persia_mission_title: "New Emirs in Persia"
 rum_new_emirs_in_persia_mission_desc: "Even having reestablished Seljuk hegemony in Persia, there will surely be several local rulers and emirs who do not accept our rule. Thus, let us work hard to win over the emirs and establish ourselves as the sole hegemons of Persia."
 rum_palace_in_iconium_mission_title: "Grand Palace in Iconium"
 rum_palace_in_iconium_mission_desc: "The city of Iconium is the royal seat of the Seljuk dynasty. As we continue to grow in power, wealth and prestige, we shall need to continually renovate and expand the royal palace, as any palace in the world would be judged as a symbol of its royal family's opulence."
 rum_seljuk_architecture_mission_title: "Seljuk Architecture"
 rum_seljuk_architecture_mission_desc: "Blending Iranian and Byzantine styles as well as Armenian, Georgian, Syrian and Central Asian architectural styles, our Seljuk architecture is unlike anything that the world has ever seen, representing a blend of cultures that reflect the nature of our own sultanate. As we continue to expand our Sultanate of Rum, we must be sure to also spread our architectural legacy by constructing great and magnificent mosques, madrasas and caravanserais across the realm."
 rum_rally_under_the_eagle_mission_title: "Rally Under the Eagle"
 rum_rally_under_the_eagle_mission_desc: "The double-headed eagle of our standard was adopted by our Sultans of Rum, an ancient symbol dating back centuries and also adopted by other great powers such as the Romans. Our royal palaces are decorated with this eagle, and it is under this eagle that our brave soldiers of Rum fight. Let us therefore call upon the warriors of Rum to lend us their arms in battle, whether they be elite Turkish nobles or lower-class Anatolian levies."
 rum_recruit_the_ghilman_mission_title: "Recruit the Ghilman"
 rum_recruit_the_ghilman_mission_desc: "The Seljuk armies as well as the royal palace guard are bolstered by the ranks of the ghilman, enslaved youths taken from non-Muslim communities who serve in our armed forces. These ghilman are mostly taken from Greek communities that were once under the rule of the Byzantine Empire. Let us continue our expansion into non-Muslim territories so we may continue to bolster the ranks of our military."
 rum_askar_and_daylamite_mission_title: "Askari and Daylamites"
 rum_askar_and_daylamite_mission_desc: "The Askari are tribal warriors who serve as the cavalry and mounted archers in the Seljuk army. On the other hand, the Daylamites are Iranian peoples whose skill in infantry combat have prompted various Middle Eastern powers to recruit them to serve in their respective forces - the Daylamites themselves were able to establish their own powerful state as the Buyid dynasty, which fell to our ancestors the Great Seljuks. As we expand into new lands, it is essential that we focus on both infantry and cavalry so we may fight effectively on all terrains."
 rum_a_seljuk_empire_mission_title: "A Seljuk Empire"
 rum_a_seljuk_empire_mission_desc: "It has been quite a long time since the works 'Seljuk' and 'Empire' have been associated with one another, as the collapse of Seljuk authority in Persia and our wars with the Byzantines and Cilicians set the stage for what seemed like the end of Seljuk imperial hegemony. However, against all odds we Seljuks of Rum rose from the ashes of the fallen Seljuk Empire and now rule over an empire in our own right."
 rum_roman_aristocracy_mission_title: "Roman Aristocracy"
 rum_roman_aristocracy_mission_desc: "Although we Seljuk Turks are the undisputed rulers of our realm, the Greek aristocratic families still possess much influence. Thus, it would be wise to appease these Greek nobles to earn their loyalty as well as their willing service, as many of the Greeks are experienced in administration."
 rum_greek_administration_mission_title: "Greek Administration"
 rum_greek_administration_mission_desc: "Having earned the trust of the Greek aristocrats and administrators, we now possess a great amount of capable and loyal administrators in the former lands of the Roman Empire. Let us therefore continue adopting and adapting aspects of Roman and Greek administration as we see fit."
 rum_greco_persian_renaissance_mission_title: "Greco-Persian Renaissance"
 rum_greco_persian_renaissance_mission_desc: "Our culture and government are based on the Perso-Islamic as well as the Greco-Roman tradition. Thus, we have the rare opportunity of ushering in a new rebirth of the Greco-Persian blend of culture, similar to what was observed during the height of the Hellenistic period following the conquests of Alexander the Great. Thus, let us work towards developing our lands and minds so we may unite cultures from Persia and Greece together into a new cultural and intellectual renaissance."
 rum_the_land_of_the_romans_mission_title: "The Land of the Romans"
 rum_the_land_of_the_romans_mission_desc: "The name of our state, 'Rûm', is derived from the fact that our Sultanate rules in Anatolia, also known as the 'Land of the Romans.' While we have claimed the title of Sultan of Rûm, the Byzantine Empire to the west still contends with our armies for control of their former lands. To ensure our victory over the Byzantines, we must consolidate our position in Anatolia."
 rum_legacy_of_manzikert_mission_title: "Legacy of Manzikert"
 rum_legacy_of_manzikert_mission_desc: "At the Battle of Manzikert, the great Seljuk Sultan Alp Arslan dealt a devastating defeat to the Byzantine Empire - half of the Byzantine forces deserted, and their Turkic mercenaries defected to Alp Arslan, highlighting our Sultan's superior authority and backing by God. Furthermore, the Battle of Manzikert marked a significant turning point, driving the Byzantines into decline and allowing us Seljuks to push forward with the momentum to establish atabegs in Rûm. Thus, as our state of Rûm is itself the result of Alp Arslan's grand campaign, we shall continue his legacy by driving the Byzantines off the western shores of Anatolia and take one more step towards seizing all of the land of the Romans for ourselves!"
 rum_seize_the_roman_throne_mission_title: "Seize the Roman Throne"
 rum_seize_the_roman_throne_mission_desc: "The city of Constantinople is also known as the City of the World's Desire, being the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. As the Sultans of Rûm, capturing Constantinople, a city that has never fallen to foreign invasion, would greatly legitimize our rule as the Sultans of the Land of the Romans, paving the way for us to establish our own Seljuk empire in Hellas."
 rum_across_the_propontis_mission_title: "Across the Propontis"
 rum_across_the_propontis_mission_desc: "The Propontis is the sea dividing our territories in Anatolia from the mainland of Greece in the west. Now that we possess the city of Constantinople, we opened a path for a direct land invasion of Greece while fighting in our own ideal conditions on land and on horseback. Let us first target the lands of Thrace before we continue our march towards the historic heartland of Greece."
 rum_hegemon_of_hellas_mission_title: "Hegemon of Hellas"
 rum_hegemon_of_hellas_mission_desc: "The Greeks of Anatolia and Thrace have already been placed under our rule, and now only the citizens of Central Greece and the Peloponnese remain outside of our sphere of control. As legitimate successors of the Roman emperors of Constantinople, let us reunite the Greek lands and place their peoples under our protection."
 rum_rome_for_romans_mission_title: "Rome for Romans"
 rum_rome_for_romans_mission_desc: "Despite being the Sultanate of the Land of the Romans, the actual city of Rome is quite far from our reach. Even the Roman Emperors of Constantinople have not held Rome proper for centuries. As we continue to expand westward towards the central Mediterranean, each new conquest shall serve as but a stepping stone towards eventually capturing the Eternal City itself so the Seljuk dynasty may become proper Sultans of Rome."
 rum_messengers_of_islam_mission_title: "Messengers of Islam"
 rum_messengers_of_islam_mission_desc: "Unlike many of the more prominent Islamic powers of our time, we Seljuks of Rûm have the unique opportunity of expanding into new lands with little to no Muslim communities. This grants us a unique role as messengers of Islam in the west, spreading the true Islamic doctrine deeper into European lands that are historically Christian. Let us therefore invite more of God's children the Islamic community by expanding the borders of the Islamic World."
 rum_patron_of_persianization_mission_title: "Patron of Persianization"
 rum_patron_of_persianization_mission_desc: "Although it has been some time since we ruled in Persia, we Seljuks still retain many Persian traditions and customs. Persian governance and kingship still influence our system of rule, and Persian is still the official language of the court and country - even our Sultans and princes are given Persian names at birth."
 rum_friends_of_the_sultan_mission_title: "Friends of the Sultan"
 rum_friends_of_the_sultan_mission_desc: "Although we obtained autonomy from both the Seljuks in Persia as well as the Romans in Constantinople, we must seek trustworthy allies if we wish to survive and thrive as a great sultanate in the lands of the Romans."

 rum_loyal_emirs_of_rum_mission_desc: "Our state began as a subject of the Great Seljuks, and the success of our early founders in Anatolia is proof of the importance of capable subjects, especially as we aim to expand far beyond Iconium. Let us therefore gather capable emirs and other vassals who shall support us loyally in times of trouble."

 rum_greeks_of_trebizond_mission_desc: "The Black Sea to the north is also known in Greek as the 'Euxeinos Pontos,' meaning the 'Hospitable Sea' thanks to successful Greek Milesian colonization along its coasts many, many centuries ago. Among the most prominent port cities of the sea is Trebizond, a notable Byzantine city protected by notable fortifications. Trebizond itself is a major hub for trade between Europe and Asia, and the city is the main port through which Byzantine silks are shipped to Muslim markets to the east. It is therefore imperative that we seize the city if we wish to expand our economic and naval influence in the Hospitable Sea."
 rum_trade_colony_in_kirim_mission_title: "Trade Colony in Kirim"
 rum_trade_colony_in_kirim_mission_desc: "Kirim is a major trading post along the northern coast of the Black Sea, and various powers and peoples have fought for its lands throughout history, whether they be Greeks, Scythians, Mongols or Romans. If we wish to expand our influence over the Black Sea trade, the city of Kirim would be an ideal trading colony for projecting our economic hegemony."
 rum_pontic_trade_monopoly_mission_title: "Pontic Trade Monopoly"
 rum_pontic_trade_monopoly_mission_desc: "With key port cities of the Black Sea now firmly under our control, including the prestigious Constantinople itself, we now have the foundation for greatly expanding our influence in the lucrative trade of the Black Sea. Let us use our economic influence to monopolize the Black Sea economy by regulating the flow of trade in and out of the sea through Constantinople."

 rum_mosques_in_the_balkans_mission_desc: "As we expand into the lands of the Balkans north of mainland Greece, we bring with us not only Seljuk rule but also the true doctrine of God. To consolidate the presence of Islam in the Balkans, it would be wise for us to sponsor the construction of various mosques as local houses of worship as well as centers of conversion."

If we overextend our borders, it will be difficult to govern distant lands as well as keep them loyal. Thus, let us establish a sphere of vassals and tributaries who shall serve our best interests, a system similar to what the Chinese empires have maintained for generations."

 xib_cross_into_goryeo_mission_title: "Cross into Goryeo"
 xib_cross_into_goryeo_mission_desc: "While the lands of Korea have been a target for raids in the past, Korea also shares a deeper historical connection with our tribes. During our wars with the Xiongnu, several Xianbei and Wuhuan families migrated to the lands of Korea, adopting Korean surnames such as Kim. Many of these Korean families today are descended from the Donghu tribes of the Xianbei and Wuhuan, and there are also several of Xiongnu descent in Korea as well. We therefore have the right to reunite these lost Xianbei and Wuhuan to their ancestral home through conquest."

 xib_raids_against_wa_mission_desc: "We have led raiding expeditions against the island country of Wa in the past. Located across the sea to the far east, Wa is ruled by various tribal confederations and kingdoms. Now that we have established a great empire with a capable navy, let us seek greater ambitions beyond mere raids and instead lead a grand expedition across the waves to subjugate the Wa kingdoms."
 xib_silk_road_hegemon_mission_title: "Silk Road Hegemon"
 xib_silk_road_hegemon_mission_desc: "The Silk Road is a source of great wealth for the merchants that participate in it, carrying lucrative caravans of silk from the rich lands of China westwards to lands and peoples we have little to no knowledge of. As we expand our territories, we must also keep in mind this lucrative business and seek a monopoly over the silk trade."
 xib_develop_writing_mission_title: "[Root.GetName]\nWriting"
 xib_develop_writing_mission_desc: "Although we initially had no script of our own, we have recently adapted the characters used by the Chinese into a written language of our own. With the Chinese letters phonetically representing the Xianbei language in script, we can now preserve knowledge and track information with greater efficiency. With a capable ruler or administration, we would be able to make the best of this new innovation."

 xib_reunite_the_donghu_mission_desc: "Our ancestors were called the Donghu, the ‘eastern barbarians,’ by the Han. The Donghu were forcefully split into the Xianbei and Wuhuan tribes after being defeated by the Xiongnu. To this day, our cousins still share the same language as us, and they also share many ideas and traditions that are similar to ours. Let us therefore reunite the Donghu descendants, Xianbei and Wuhuan, to bolster our forces for our inevitable wars with the Han Chinese."

 xib_seize_liaodong_mission_desc: "The relatively-sparse cities and fortifications of Liaodong serve as the northeasternmost frontier of the Han dynasty, and its generals and governors have defended the frontier from us and other nomadic tribes such as the Xiongnu for generations. Besides its military significance, Liaodong also serves as an economic bridge between the Han heartland and the northeast, with trade networks between Liaodong and the peoples of Korea as well as our own tribes. By seizing Liaodong, we would be taking our first steps towards invading the Han empire's core territories."

 xib_question_of_sinicization_mission_desc: "As we conquer more and more Chinese territories, we also acquire new Chinese subjects. While these Chinese subjects a class below our tribes in the social hierarchy, many [Root.GetAdjective] nobles have adopted Chinese customs and culture, with some even adopting Chinese surnames in place of the names held by their forefathers. Thus, perhaps it would be wise for us to allow this sinicization to occur so we may better integrate our Chinese subjects and be viewed by them as one of their own."

However, as we have now expanded far and wide across the steppes, we have established an empire that can even challenge the Emperor of China. To the south, the Qin and Han dynasties constructed a Great Wall across their northern frontier. Therefore, we must make the first move and lead a grand offensive campaign to seize a foothold in Chinese lands on the other side of the Great Wall."

 xib_flying_horses_mission_desc: "A prominent feature of Xianbei art is the flying horse, a winged horse depicted throughout Xianbei culture. Furthermore, our horses are faster and stronger than those of the Xiongnu, and we Xianbei were also among the first on the steppes to make use of the stirrup, an innovation that has allowed us to dominate on the battlefield. Let us continue this tradition of mounted warfare and utilize our horses and stirrup technology to their greatest potential."

 xib_supplant_the_chanyu_mission_desc: "The Chanyu of the Xiongnu confederation has long been rivals to our tribe. Having driven our Donghu forefathers further and further east, the Xiongnu had established a great confederation in their own right. However, since they have been dealt defeat after defeat by the Chinese empire of the Han to the south, the Xiongnu have fallen into further and further decline.

While the autonomy wielded by each of these clans and their chiefs holds the confederation together, it also prevents further centralization and consolidation of power in the hands of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

 xib_northern_agriculture_mission_desc: "Our economic base relies primarily on animal husbandry as well as agriculture, the latter being especially important as we continue to expand further south into lands occupied by sedentary peoples such as the Han Chinese and the Koreans. Thus, let us develop our own agricultural techniques inspired by those of the Chinese and other sedentary groups we shall encounter and conquer."
 xib_monuments_to_tengri_mission_title: "Monuments to Tengri"
 xib_monuments_to_tengri_mission_desc: "As a result of architectural influences from China as well as from followers of the Buddhist faith, whose numbers have been increasing in our lands as of late, we have learned to appreciate the value of constructing temples and other religious monuments. Thus, as we establish more permanent settlments for agriculture, let us also erect stationary monuments and temples to the great Tengri."

 xib_conquer_the_wusun_mission_desc: "The Wusun are another formidable steppe people, having both allied with and fought against the Xiongnu in the past with notable success. Furthermore, the Wusun are located to the far west of our confederation and are thus only one of many stepping stones for our growing nomadic empire, one that we shall conquer and integrate into our confederation to fulfill greater ambitions."

 xib_subjugate_the_jushi_mission_desc: "The Tocharian city-states, known to the Chinese as the Jushi, have had a long history with the Han dynasty. During the War of the Heavenly Horses, Chinese generals advanced through the Tocharian cities to attack their primary enemies, the Dayuan. With the Dayuan defeated, the Chinese established the Protectorate of the Western Regions, placing a Han Protector-General that controlled the various Tocharian cities. Recently, the Han's grasp over these lands has weakened as they faced uprisings from the nearby Qiang and from within."

 xib_defeat_kangju_mission_desc: "The kingdom of Sogdiana, known to the Chinese as 'Kangju,' is ruled by nomadic tribes from the west, its kingdom made up of both sedentary cities and steppe settlements. Before the Kangju, there existed the Greek kingdom of Dayuan - however, Dayuan was defeated in the War of Heavenly Horses against the Han dynasty; this war resulted in the Han acquiring the famed Ferghana hanxuema, or 'blood-sweating horses,' an asset that allowed the Han to defeat their Xiongnu rivals in the north. With Ferghana under our control, these horses would also be ours."
 xib_a_new_trade_empire_mission_title: "[Root.GetName] Trade Empire"
 xib_a_new_trade_empire_mission_desc: "With the conquest of Sogdia and our dominance over the northern steppe, we control many vital points of trade between the east and the west, most notably the lucrative silk trade from China to the western kingdoms.

 pis_imperial_relations_mission_title: "Imperial Relations"
 pis_imperial_relations_mission_desc: "As members of the Holy Roman Empire, it is vital that we maintain cordial relations with the Emperor so we may be properly recognized, both politically and economically.

 pis_byzantine_trading_rights_mission_desc: "The prestigious name of the Pisans is now known far and wide, so much so that Byzantine emperors have given us exclusive trading and mooring rights in the empire, most notably Constantinople.

 pis_humble_the_fiorentinos_mission_title: "Humble the Fiorentinos"
 pis_humble_the_fiorentinos_mission_desc: "The city of Florence and its citizens view us Pisans with utter contempt - it is safe to say that the feeling is mutual. The arrogant Fiorentinos not only disagree with us politically such as regarding the Investiture Controversy, with the Guelph Fiorentinos clashing ideologically against the majority Ghibellini Pisans. Furthermore, Florence has gradually been rising in prosperity and prominence as of late - it is our duty as proud Pisans to squash them before they become too much to handle and strike some humility into the Fiorentinos!"
 pis_usurp_the_margravi_mission_title: "Usurp the Margravi"
 pis_usurp_the_margravi_mission_desc: "While the comune of Pisa is de jure a vassal of the Margravi of Tuscany, we have gained de facto political independence from the Tuscans, even gaining recognition from the Emperor. If we gain enough power and influence, perhaps we can even usurp the Margravi and become the hegemons of Tuscany, establishing our own league of cities as leaders of the new Tuscan League."

 pis_march_across_the_po_mission_desc: "To the north across the great and vast Po River reside several thriving cities that rival our own, such as the city of Milan.

 pis_fortify_the_passes_mission_desc: "Although we have quelled the Italian cities in the north, there are many ambitious imperial powers, and thus potential rivals, even further beyond the northern passes of the Alps. Perhaps an Emperor in the north may even oppose us one day and march down towards Pisa with his army. Thus, let us fortify the passes in the north to ensure no such power shall ver threaten the Pisan homeland."
 pis_papal_recognition_mission_title: "Papal Recognition"
 pis_papal_recognition_mission_desc: "While we Pisans have long been staunch Ghibellines, supporters of the Emperor in the Investiture Controversy, it cannot be denied that it is essential to maintain cordial relations with the Papacy, to remain pious to our faith as well as to ensure the political prominence and autonomy of our comune."

 pis_customs_of_the_sea_mission_desc: "While there is much debate between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines over the right of investiture, it can be agreed upon by almost all Pisans that the there are few besides the Pope and the Emperor themselves who possess the authority and diplomatic reputation to ordain the customs of the sea. Thus, should we win the backing of both the Emperor and the Papacy, the Pisan customs of sea and trade would surely be recognized as the standard customs of the western Mediterranean."

 pis_long_march_to_calabria_mission_desc: "The region of Calabria is one of many regions in southern Italy that we wish to place under our political and economic influence. Possessing many port cities that are directly tied to distant shores across the Mediterranean in its vast trade network, the cities of southern Italy would surely benefit our comune and our treasury should they be placed under Pisan hegemony."

 pis_italian_cardinals_mission_desc: "Now that we have established Pisan suzerainty over a significant and unprecedented number of prominent Italian cities, we can turn our attention from the temporal realm to the realm of the church.

 pis_the_comune_on_the_arno_mission_desc: "The city of Pisa is one of several prominent comunes along the Arno River, another of which being our rivals in Florence.

 pis_duomo_di_pisa_mission_desc: "Thanks to our wealth amassed from trade, we Pisans have constructed many beautiful and grand churches across the realm. At the same time, however, we continue to face competition from other thriving trade cities such as Genoa and Venice, with each city still stubbornly claiming to possess the grandest church in all of Italy. Thus, let us construct a great church of Pisa, one more beautiful and luxurious than any other church the world has ever seen - and let us pay for this church at the expense of our enemies..."

 pis_monopoly_of_emporia_mission_desc: "With the major trading ports of the Genoa and Venice now under our control, we Pisans now dominate major trade routes along both the east and west shores of Italy.

 pis_overlord_of_meridione_mission_desc: "With the conquest of Sicily and the regions of southern Italy, we would achieve unprecendented authority in southern Italy, a level of absolute authority that has not been seen in Italy for centuries. In such a period of division and strife between the various cities, comunes and crowns of Italy, achieving unification can bring only good to the Italian people - even if our new subjects disagree."
 pis_mare_nostrum_mission_title: "Mare Nostrum"
 pis_mare_nostrum_mission_desc: "To the Romans, the Mediterranean Sea was known as 'Mare Nostrum,' meaning 'Our Sea,' as the entirety of the Mediterranean was under the control of the Roman Empire. While it is unlikely that we shall ever see such a state again in history, we can only hope to emulate our ancestors by establishing widespread control over the Mediterranean of our current generation."
 pis_rising_merchant_class_mission_title: "Rising Merchant Class"
 pis_rising_merchant_class_mission_desc: "Although the aristocratic families had long dominated affairs in Pisa as well as Tuscany as a whole, the emergence of Pisa has allowed the merchant class to rise in both wealth and influence, with many members of the merchant class now occupying influential offices in the Pisan comune, with some even elected as consuls of Pisa. It would therefore be wise to seek alliances with the most influential of merchant families."
 pis_fortified_ports_system_mission_title: "Fortified Ports"
 pis_fortified_ports_system_mission_desc: "The ports of Pisa are defended by sea towers as well as a system of fortresses on the hills surrounding our city.

 pis_patriarch_of_jerusalem_mission_desc: "In the First Crusade, the Pisan forces were among the first crusading armies to take Jerusalem.

 pis_old_families_of_tuscany_mission_desc: "There are a number of old aristocratic families in Pisa, with some families such as the Alliata tracing their lineage as far back as 325 AD during the reign of the famed Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Other families such as the Della Gherardesca, Caetani and Upezzinghi are similarly old and prominent. Furthermore, these aristocratic families all share a fear of being overshadowed by the rising merchant class, and they also continue to quarrel amongst themselves in personal feuds. Thus, let us alleviate their fears by appeasing the nobility and heeding their advice as well as their concerns."
 pis_reform_the_administration_mission_title: "Reform the Consulate"
 pis_reform_the_administration_mission_desc: "While we were given the permission to elect our own consuls by the Emperor himself, our homely comune of Pisa is still plagued by constant infighting between the various classes of Pisan society, the most notable being the old aristocratic families and the rising merchant class. It is therefore clear to many that our government is still in need of reform, and that there is still much to do before we can establish a truly stable and impartial consulate that works only for the greater good."

 pis_great_galleys_of_pisa_mission_desc: "Our fleet is the main military force of Pisa, allowing us to project our authority and influence far beyond Italian shores and into distant lands such as Africa and the Levant.

 pis_sardinia_et_corsica_mission_desc: "The islands of Sardinia and Corsica have long been contested between us and our rivals, whether they be the ambitious Genoese in the north or the Muslim emirs to the south. Meanwhile, the Judicates of Sardinia are also a major part of the struggle, with some of the Judicates wanting full autonomy, while others are more willing to work with foreign powers like us. Thus, let us use a combination of martial might, naval supremacy and cunning to bring all of Sardinia and Corsica under Pisan control."

 pis_mahdia_campaign_mission_desc: "The pirates from Mahdia have long plagued the waters of the southern Mediterranean, and many Pisan merchants and ships have fallen victim to them.

 pis_an_emporium_in_alxandria_mission_desc: "While our Pisan merchants established trade influence in Egypt quite some time ago, before we gained a foothold in Africa we could have never imagined that the lands of Egypt would within the reach of the extended Pisan realm. With Alexandria only a few days away from our center of authority in Africa, perhaps Alexandria could become an emporium of Pisa."

 cls_temples_to_shiva_mission_desc: "Chola temples are not only places of worship but also monuments of royal legitimacy and centers of economic activity, allowing Tamil kings to expand their sphere of royal authority from temples. The construction of temples and the educational and medical institutions around them serves as a projection of royal authority as a benevolent presence in the farther reaches of the kingdom. Thus, as we of the Chola dynasty have historically favored the worship of Lord Shiva as personal deities, let us continue building temples to Lord Shiva as well as various other gods."
 cls_brihadisvara_temple_mission_title: "Brihadisvara Temple"
 cls_brihadisvara_temple_mission_desc: "The Brihadisvara Temple is one of several Great Chola Temples in the heart of the Chola country. As temples are not only places of worship but also sources of charity, centers of commerce and symbols of royal authority, it is in our best interest to continue renovating and expanding our great temples so we may project the power of the Chola dynasty as well as display to all, including Lord Shiva Himself, that we are pious devotees of the gods and thus followers of the Aram, known in Sanskrit as Dharma."

The Srivijaya kingdom rules over the strait of Malacca, a point through which sea trade between India and China pass.

On the other hand, the Mohe have also long served in our armies as auxiliary infantry and are thus a valuable military asset in wartime. Thus, let us turn a thorn into a boon by placing all of Dongbuyeo, or Eastern Buyeo, under our protection as well as fully subjugating the tribes of the Mohe people in the far northeast."

 byz2_byzantine_churches_mission_desc: "While our earliest state-sponsored churches were originally focused around the major urban centers, there has been a recent trend of smaller centralized churches emerging across the imperial realm.

 byz2_one_empire_one_church_mission_desc: "As we Romans have learned throughout history, a stable empire is one that is supported by loyal subjects. One aspect of loyalty is loyalty to God and the Church - to ensure stability and salvation to our people, we must ensure they all follow the same holy doctrine sponsored by our state."
 byz2_shield_of_christendom_mission_title: "Shield of Christendom"
 byz2_shield_of_christendom_mission_desc: "Ever since the Islamic invasions, we have mostly been on the defensive, utilizing both land and sea forces to ensure the walls of Constantinople did not fall to the heathen invaders. However, our armies are not solely for the defense of Constantinople - we must also dedicate ourselves to becoming true defenders of Christendom, offering our arms to any follower of the true doctrine in their times of trouble."

 byz2_declare_the_crusade_mission_desc: "The Muslim Caliphs humiliated us through their conquests, seizing the lands of Egypt, Syria, the Levant and Africa from Roman control, lands that our forefathers had fought so hard to secure for the glory of Rome. Thus, with our religious matters settled at home, it is time that we take the battle to the heathens once more and wage a great crusade against our enemies beyond the bounds of Christendom!"
 byz2_roman_fire_mission_title: "Roman Fire"
 byz2_roman_fire_mission_desc: "Known by many names, Roman Fire is one of many of our brilliant innovations - a fire that cannot be put out by water and therefore incredibly effective in naval battles, Roman fire has been widely adopted by our imperial fleet. It is now up to us to foster a navy and admirals capable enough to effectively utilize it."

 byz2_megale_hellas_mission_desc: "Known in Latin as Magna Graecia, the cities of southern Italy thrived under Greek and Roman rule alike.

 byz2_restore_order_from_ravenna_mission_desc: "The Exarchate of Ravenna was established by Justinian to govern much of Italy on his behalf. However, the exarchate was destroyed by the invading Lombards shortly after Justinian reigned triumphant in Italy.

 byz2_question_of_iconoclasm_mission_desc: "We have had numerous passioned debates about the veneration of icons, but it seems that each time we have reached a conclusion, the resolution served to settle the controversy only temporarily.

 byz2_adriatic_trading_mission_title: "Adriatic Trading"
 byz2_adriatic_trading_mission_desc: "Byzantine trade in the Adriatic Sea, from Constantinople to our emporia along the Adriatic, carries the bulk of our Mediterranean goods in comparison to the lack of bulk goods moved in and out of Crimea. Thus, it is important that we continue to establish direct control over Adriatic trade to cultivate emporia, trade cities, as well as regulate the trade as efficiently as we do in the waters surrounding Constantinople."
 byz2_the_bishop_of_rome_mission_title: "The Patriarch of Rome"
 byz2_the_bishop_of_rome_mission_desc: "Disagreements and distrust between the Bishop of Rome and the Patriarch of Constantinople grew following the collapse of Roman authority in the western empire.

 byz2_reinstate_the_pentarchy_mission_title: "Reinstate the Pentarchy"
 byz2_reinstate_the_pentarchy_mission_desc: "Before the loss of the Patriarchates of Rome, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem, these four patriarchates had coexisted with the Patriarch of Constantinople as the Pentarchy. While we can thank the loss of these patriarchates for the increased authority and importance of the Patriarchate of Constantinople in the Christian world, it is still our duty to return the true doctrine of Christianity to these lost cities by restoring the Patriarchs to their offices."

 byz2_mediterranean_hegemony_mission_desc: "The sea once known to us as Mare Nostrum, or ‘Our Sea,’ was taken away from us as a result of the Germanic and Arab invasions of the past centuries. As a result, our people began to call the sea Mare Mediterraneum, roughly meaning ‘Inland Sea In the Middle of the Land.’ With our naval, economic and political presence now reaching across the sea once more, let us reclaim the waters between the lands through the restoration of Roman naval bases across the open waters."
 byz2_city_of_the_worlds_desire_mission_title: "City of the World's Desire"
 byz2_city_of_the_worlds_desire_mission_desc: "To us, our capital is known as Constantinople, or Nova Roma. To all others, it is the City of the World's Desire - and yet no foreign invader has ever succeeded in penetrating its walls. Let us continue to cultivate Constantinople into a city that is worthy of the world's envy and desire."
 byz2_nine_gates_of_theodosius_mission_title: "Nine Gates of Theodosius"
 byz2_nine_gates_of_theodosius_mission_desc: "The city of Constantinople is surrounded and protected by several impenetrable walls, the most notable of these the double line of the Theodosian Walls, build during the reign of Theodosius II.\n\nSince the reign of Constantine the Great and the construction of the first great walls of Constantinople, the City of the World's Desire has never fallen to any foreign invader. Let us continue this tradition of defense through further fortification of the city's walls and garrisons."
 byz2_recruit_the_tagmata_mission_title: "Recruit the Tagmata"
 byz2_recruit_the_tagmata_mission_desc: "Most of our forces are made up of peasants from our mostly-rural populace, soldiers who fight part-time and farm part-time. Furthermore, it is these soldiers and the generals that lead them who are the most rebellious. Thus, we would benefit from expanding the ranks of the tagmata, the professional standing army of the empire. The tagmata shall serve as a reliable force that shall campaign and crush rebellions with absolute loyalty to the emperor."
 byz2_vanquish_the_bulgarians_mission_title: "Vanquish the Bulgarians"
 byz2_vanquish_the_bulgarians_mission_desc: "Since their arrival along our borders, the Bulgarians have been a thorn in our side, threatening our domains in Thrace as well as the capital of Constantinople and the lives of the Roman emperors themselves. It is therefore imperative that we crush the Bulgarians and all other barbarian polities in Thrace and Dacia who are still independent of our influence."
 byz2_foothold_in_crimea_mission_title: "Foothold in Crimea"
 byz2_foothold_in_crimea_mission_desc: "While we have established a major trading hub in Crimea, the amount of goods traded, especially bulk goods, is still lacking compared to our trading cities, or emporia, in the Aegean and Adriatic Seas. Thus, let us expand our Black Sea trade to boost our profits and send our goods to farther reaches of the north."
 byz2_replicate_nineveh_mission_title: "Replicate Nineveh"
 byz2_replicate_nineveh_mission_desc: "The Battle of Nineveh fought by Emperor Heraclius was a glorious victory against the Sassanid Persians - unfortunately, it was the last major Roman victory in Mesopotamia before the Islamic invasions. With the Caliphate driven out of Syria and back into Mesopotamia, it seems that it is only a matter of time before another Battle of Nineveh is won against the Caliph in the land of the twin rivers."
 byz2_the_church_of_the_east_mission_title: "The Church of the East"
 byz2_the_church_of_the_east_mission_desc: "When the proposed doctrine of the heretic Nestorius was rejected by us, his teachings spread in the lands east of Roman borders, taking root in Mesopotamia and Persia as the Nestorian Church. While Heraclius wished to mend the schism between our Church and that of the Nestorians, he was ultimately unsuccessful. With Mesopotamia now under our control for the first time since Trajan, perhaps reconciliation is now possible."
 byz2_birthplace_of_islam_mission_title: "Birthplace of Islam"
 byz2_birthplace_of_islam_mission_desc: "The cities of Mecca and Medina are the two holiest cities in Islam, and for good reason. They are from which the faith itself had emerged, and it is from these cities that Islam conquered our lands in the east."

 byz2_mare_nostrum_once_more_mission_desc: "It has been long since we Romans have been able to call the Mediterranean Sea 'Mare Nostrum,' meaning 'Our Sea.' While it has been centuries since the Roman Empire ruled over all of Mare Nostrum at its height, with Italy, Africa and Greece now secured by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], perhaps it is only a matter of time before the sea is all ours once more."
 byz2_basileia_rhomaion_mission_title: "Basileia Rhomaion"
 byz2_basileia_rhomaion_mission_desc: "For many generations, the legitimacy of our empire has been questioned by critics from both beyond and within the borders of our empire. As long as the western regions remain out of Roman hands, there shall always be pretenders who claim the lands of Rome, whether it be the ambitious Odoacer, the treacherous Goths or the arrogant Franks. However, the tide of history has already begun to turn, and soon all pretenders shall kneel before the might of a reunited Roman Empire."
 byz2_develop_the_themata_mission_title: "Develop the Themata"
 byz2_develop_the_themata_mission_desc: "With the great loss of territory to the Islamic invasions, we must find more efficient ways for raising troops. We have therefore granted state-owned land or tax relief to farmers and local citizens across the empire under the agreement that they shall serve in our armies whenever they are called upon by the strategoi in their respective thema, or theme. Let us continue to expand this theme system so we can more efficiently call upon our troops when faced by invaders on all fronts."

 byz2_grain_of_the_empire_mission_desc: "With the vital breadbaskets of Carthage and Egypt lost to the Arab invasions, our supply of cereals to the general populace has greatly decreased. Coupled with plague and famine, the population of Constantinople and its suburbs has been halved since before Heraclius’ campaigns. To prevent further population decline and to support our great empire, we must put more effort into growing foodstuffs and taking advantage of surpluses as they come, without the reliance of grain shipments from beyond Nova Roma."
 byz2_compile_the_basilika_mission_title: "Compile the Basilika"
 byz2_compile_the_basilika_mission_desc: "Justinian's Corpus Iuris Civilis laid the foundation for the codification of Roman law. It has, however, been some time since it's compilation, and our new situation will require some adaptations and additions to Roman law. Thus, let us commission the extension of Roman code through the compilation of further works and laws."
 byz2_a_new_good_caesar_mission_title: "A New Good Caesar"
 byz2_a_new_good_caesar_mission_desc: "A realm is only as good, just and capable as its ruler. This is and has always been the case. Thus, a stable and secure empire is in need of a Good Caesar."

 byz2_varangians_of_the_rus_mission_desc: "The valiant warriors of the Rus' above the Black Sea have been recent friends of our court and state. As a result, there are some who wish to invite these warriors to fight under our own banners as impartial elite troops. Thus, let us continue to build good relations with the peoples of the region in the hopes of recruiting a capable force for the stability and security of our throne."
 byz2_anatolic_consolidation_mission_title: "Anatolic Consolidation"
 byz2_anatolic_consolidation_mission_desc: "While we were able to repel the Muslim invaders from much of Anatolia, we must consolidate our position and reclaim all of Anatolia before we can pursue greater ambitions of retaking other Roman territories such as Syria and Egypt."
 byz2_retribution_for_yarmuk_mission_title: "Retribution for Yarmuk"
 byz2_retribution_for_yarmuk_mission_desc: "The Battle of the Yarmuk was a decisive battle in which our Roman forces were devastated by the Muslim Rashidun Caliphate, marking a major turning point in the conflict that allowed the Levant and thus Egypt and Africa to fall into the hands of the Islamic invaders. With our forces no longer on the defensive, it is time that we avenge the tens of thousands of lives lost in the campaign along the Yarmuk River."
 byz2_protect_the_true_cross_mission_title: "Protect the True Cross"
 byz2_protect_the_true_cross_mission_desc: "The True Cross of Jerusalem was returned to Jerusalem by Heraclius, having retaken the holy relic from the invading Sassanid Persian Empire. However, this was shortly before the Islamic Caliphs invaded our lands and seized Jerusalem and the Levant from us. Though relics of the True Cross were spread across Christendom as far northwest as England, the True Cross shall never be truly safe until Jerusalem is once again returned to Christian hands."
 byz2_annexation_of_aegyptos_mission_title: "Annexation of Aegyptos"
 byz2_annexation_of_aegyptos_mission_desc: "With the Levant now firmly under our control, it is time that the wealthy and abundant lands of Egypt are reclaimed by our empire. Since Alexandreia possesses great significance and history in relation to our Christian faith, securing the city and restoring the Patriarchate of Alexandreia shall allow us to benefit in both religious and temporal realms."
 byz2_exarchatus_africae_mission_title: "Exarchatus Africae"
 byz2_exarchatus_africae_mission_desc: "Though Justinian had retaken the breadbasket of Rome from the Vandals, the cities of Africa were lost once more due to the Islamic invasions. However, with our position in the east secure, we can now look further west and follow the footsteps of Justinian and Belisarius in retaking Africa."
 byz2_avenge_the_altavans_mission_title: "Avenge the Altavans"
 byz2_avenge_the_altavans_mission_desc: "The Mauri of Altava were among the last Christian forces to resist the Islamic invasion of Africa. While they were ultimately defeated, they shall be remembered as honorable subjects of Rome. Thus, with Africa retaken by our forces, we can now avenge the Altavans by driving the heathen forces from Numidia and Mauretania."
 byz2_merchant_guilds_mission_title: "Merchant Guilds"
 byz2_merchant_guilds_mission_desc: "Trade in Constantinople is run by various hereditary guilds that are subsidized by the government. As a result, the merchants of our capital enjoy several privileges such as significantly reduced duties and tolls. Even so, in Byzantine society, merchants are often distrusted by both officials and the general populace. Thus, we have put in place standards for weights, measures and prices to strictly regulate trade. Furthermore, we avoid corruption in this system by appointing kommerkiarioi, officials who collected duties, for only one year before they are moved elsewhere. With these careful considerations and costs in mind, let us use our close relationship with the empire's merchant class to ensure they shall not betray our ambitions and instead serve our interests beyond Constantinople."
 byz2_byzantine_silk_mission_title: "Byzantine Silk"
 byz2_byzantine_silk_mission_desc: "While the silk from the far east is the most popular and sought-after product of the Silk Road, we Byzantines have our own silk produced in Constantinople. As we continue to expand our borders as well as our political and economic influence, we shall be able to carve out our own Silk Road in the Mediterranean and beyond."
 byz2_the_bearded_ones_mission_title: "The Bearded Ones"
 byz2_the_bearded_ones_mission_desc: "The title of the 'Bearded Ones' refers to men granted purely honorific court titles, non-eunuchs who gained recognition without holding any actual office. However, as we continue to grow our bureaucracy and wage war, we will need more capable officials who are not dignified only in name. Thus, let us recruit new and true talents from the rising civil aristocracy to serve in our imperial court."
 byz2_war_through_diplomacy_mission_title: "War Through Diplomacy"
 byz2_war_through_diplomacy_mission_desc: "We Romans believe that diplomacy is simply a form of war by other means - why should Roman blood be shed when our interests and ambitions can be achieved through more clever means? Let us therefore treat foreign embassies especially well and invite members of the royal families of allies and subjects so the states and tribes on the periphery of the empire shall fight for our own political gain."
 byz2_strengthen_the_cavalry_mission_title: "Strengthen the Katafraktoi"
 byz2_strengthen_the_cavalry_mission_desc: "Since our wars with the Persians and Arabs in the east, our Romans armies evolved to meet the challenge. No longer infantry-focused as the Roman legions of old, our new Eastern Roman armies are supported by armored heavy cavalry, katafraktoi, along with other cavalry units such as the medium-armored koursorses or lightly-armored mounted archers. Let us hone our cavalry like a blade so it shall never break upon clashing with the cavalries of our enemies."
 byz2_military_reforms_mission_title: "Military Reforms"
 byz2_military_reforms_mission_desc: "One weakness of our military is how decentralized it is; as the provinces’ main payment to our state is through military service, local leaders throughout the empire are able to levy peasants in their regions, both for our campaigns as well as against us. To limit the power of these local leaders and ensure our armies serve only the interests of the emperor, we will need to make reforms to both our army as well as our administration and system of governance."
 byz2_armenian_subjects_mission_title: "Armenian Subjects"
 byz2_armenian_subjects_mission_desc: "The Armenians became religiously and politically isolated from the Roman Empire through their constant struggles against the invading Persians in the east, a divide that has only been exacerbated by the Islamic invasions. As Monophysites, the Armenians believe in Christianity yet follow a sect and church distinct from our own. It seems that to mend this schism, we will need to reintegrate Armenia as well as the surrounding kingdoms of the Caucauses into the Roman Empire."

 byz2_heraclius_woes_mission_title: "Heraclius' Woes"
 byz2_heraclius_woes_mission_desc: "The Emperor Heraclius had attempted to mend the schism between our own Church and those of the Monophysites and Nestorians in the east. Despite his best efforts and the initial cooperation of Monophysite and Nestorian leaders, Heraclius' dreams were ultimately unachieved. With the Monophysites now living under our own empire in Armenia, it shall hopefully be easier to reconcile past ecclesiastical disagreements."
 byz2_cultivate_alexandreia_mission_title: "Cultivate Alexandreia"
 byz2_cultivate_alexandreia_mission_desc: "Following the Islamic conquest of Egypt, Muslim rulers established new cities in the region such as Fustat, which they favored over the former Christian and intellectual center of Alexandreia. Having plundered Alexandreia of its riches, the Caliphs allowed the once great city to fall into decay. With Egypt now under our control, it is up to us to restore Alexandreia as a symbol of an ancient Christian, Roman and Greek legacy, overshadowing all of the cities built by the Islamic invaders."
 byz2_nova_romas_breadbasket_mission_title: "Nova Roma's Breadbasket"
 byz2_nova_romas_breadbasket_mission_desc: "Before Carthage became the primary source of grain for the Roman Empire, Rome had relied upon Egypt and the fertile fields of the Nile River as the main breadbasket of the empire. When the breadbasket of Africa was lost to the Vandals, however, the Eastern Roman Empire had to turn to Egypt once more. With Egypt now reconquered from Muslim rule, it is imperative that we restore the lands as Constantinople's breadbasket should future crises bring harm upon our empire."
 byz2_reconcile_african_faith_mission_title: "Reconcile African Faith"
 byz2_reconcile_african_faith_mission_desc: "The province of Africa has long been grounds for heretical struggle - from the Donatists of Carthage, to the Arian Vandals, to the Muslim rulers of today, it has been long since true orthodoxy has been allowed to thrive in Africa. With Roman Africa now in Roman hands once more, we can push for the permanent entrenchment of the true Christian doctrine in the region."

The name of the Persian god Mithra (proto-Indo-Iranian Mitra), adapted into Greek as Mithras, was linked to a new and distinctive imagery. Writers of the Roman Empire period referred to this mystery religion by phrases which can be anglicized as Mysteries of Mithras or Mysteries of the Persians; modern historians refer to it as Mithraism, or sometimes Roman Mithraism. The mysteries were popular in the Roman military. Worshippers of Mithras had a complex system of seven grades of initiation, with ritual meals. Initiates called themselves syndexioi, those 'united by the handshake'. They met in underground temples (called mithraea), which survive in large numbers. It has been estimated that there would have been at least 680–690 mithraea in Rome."

 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME1: "The Traditional Amazigh Religion"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC1: "It is difficult to fully reconstruct the indigenous religious beliefs of the Berber people prior to the spread of Christianity and Islam into North Africa. As an Afro-Asiatic people, mythological and linguistic comparison with the Phoenician and Egyptian cultures is helpful as well as archeological evidence found throughout North Africa. However, the majority of written evidence concerning Berber religion comes from neighboring (particularly Greek and Egyptian) sources. Additionally, some ancient Berber beliefs continue to exist within modern Berber culture, albeit significantly altered."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT1: "Okay"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME2: "Celebrating Yennayer"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC2: "Yennayer is the first day of the agrarian year used since antiquity by Berber people in North Africa. It corresponds to the first day of January of the Julian Calendar. This is a widespread celebration, during which some rituals take place, mostly operations of cleansing and animal sacrifices. For this year, your advisors have suggested you take an active part in preparing the celebrations. Our people would be very grateful."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT2A: "Join in the celebrations"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT2B: "I have more important things to do!"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME3: "The Legacy of Shoshenq I"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC3: "Shoshenq I was a Berber Pharaoh. He is the founder of the XXII dynasty. He is so popular among our people that his coronation has been taken as the beginning of the Amazigh calendar. Since we own Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt, we have a huge amount of prestige. This prestige can help us to improve our reputation abroad... But we could also remind the world that one of the greatest dynasties of pharaohs is of Amazigh origin. This way, we could pretend to rule over all Egyptian lands."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT3A: "We are the legitimate rulers of Egypt!"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT3B: "The whole world must be in awe of your prestige."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME4: "Restoring the Madghacen"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC4: "The Madghacen is a royal mausoleum-temple of the Berber Numidian Kings, dating from the third century BC.

The Cathars professed a neo-Manichaean dualism; that there are two principles, one good and the other evil, and that the material world is evil. Although the various groups emphasized different doctrines, they all agreed that matter was evil. Man was an alien and a sojourner in an evil world; his aim must be to free his spirit, which was in its nature good, and restore it to communion with God. There were strict rules for fasting, including the total prohibition of meat. Sexual intercourse was forbidden; complete ascetic renunciation of the world was called for. Under constant persecution by the Catholic Church, the Cathar hierarchy faded out in the 1270s. The heresy lingered through the fourteenth century and finally disappeared early in the fifteenth."

 cpbm_imperial.EVTNAME8: "Christian Persecutions"
 cpbm_imperial.EVTDESC8: "Rome has always been tolerant towards most of the other religions. However, the rise of Christianity is alarming. Some Christian sects are closely monitored. Following the trail of fish-figures painted on the walls of the city, our praetorian guard managed to stop a group of Christians. They were found guilty of thefts and fires that occurred recently in the city... even if their guilt could not have really been proven. It is time to show our people that we do not approve the presence of sectarian aberrations. You have the honor to choose how these heathens will die."

 cpbm_imperial.EVTNAME9: "Sol Invictus"
 cpbm_imperial.EVTDESC9: "The empire has serious crisis of faith. Our people is no longer interested in the old Hellenist gods, and the imperial cult itself begins to fall into disuse. To unify all the peoples of our nation, our best theologist proposed to establish the cult of Sol Invictus (meaning 'Unconquered Sun' in Latin). The Unconquered Sun is a solar deity, which incorporates aspects of the mythology of Apollo and the cult of Mithra, and certain aspects of Christianity. Sol Invictus is above all the other religions, but local cults are still authorized, whether or not they are polytheists. This deity should ensure some stability... at least from a religious point of view."

 cpbm_imperial.EVTDESC10: "$PROVINCENAME$ recently produced big harvests. To thank the deified emperor for his help, the people made offerings for Caesar, one of the founders of the imperial cult. The priests of the province announced that they gathered a significant amount of money. As the emperor, this money given by your people is rightfully yours... But perhaps you would like to thank these people for their kindness?"
 cpbm_imperial.EVTOPT10A: "Good idea. We will use this money to develop the province."

 cpbm_imperial.EVTDESC11: "Augustus is one of the most celebrated emperors by the Romans. This may be because he is one of the first deified emperors of in the imperial cult. Nevertheless, the province of $PROVINCENAME$ is particularly devoted to him. Many wealthy citizens would like to build a temple of Augustus in their capital. They are even willing to pay the entire cost of construction of the temple! However, as you are their emperor, they would like you to supervise the construction, and they would be honored if you could inaugurate the monument. What do you think ?"

Indeed, you are perceived as a great emperor, beloved by everyone. Therefore, the people want you to be deified during your lifetime. This is the consecration of your reign over the empire. You are now one of the most famous emperors Rome has ever known, alongside Augustus and Caesar."

With the rise of the imperial cult, it became the personal guard of the emperor, but also a military reserve that can turn the tide of a battle. This unit, however, arouses the jealousy of the legionaries, the latter being much less paid and have make a much longer military service. This elite guard has been dissolved and reformed many times during the history of Rome. Today, the conditions for the reassembling of this unit are met."

 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC3: "When the first Mormon pioneers settled down in new lands, they expressed the wish to create their own recognized government. This was the birth of the State of Deseret, whose name derives from the term 'honeybee' mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Taking advantage of unrest in the nation, Mormon religious leaders drafted a constitution, declaring their independence. Faced with the fervor of the Mormon people, clashes between local militias and representatives of the security forces are becoming more violent. It seems now that an armed conflict is inevitable."

 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC8: "The Deseret alphabet is a phonological spelling reform which was created by the Board of Regents of the University of Deseret, under the leadership of Brigham Young. Young claimed that this alphabet was intended to replace the traditional Latin alphabet with an alternative, more phonetically accurate alphabet. However, until now, this writing has been taught only in schools and seminars. One of our advisors proposes to adopt this alphabet for good. The cost of such a change is important, because we will have to reprint our books and review all our official documents. However, in the long term, the use of our very own alphabet will reinforce the sense of belonging to a very unique and blessed nation."

One of these missionaries particularly distinguished. His knowledge of our religion is unparalleled. He could become one of the greatest theologians of our time, if we give him more responsibilities within our nation. In this case, the best solution would be that he integrates the governing body of our Church"

 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC13: "'Choose the right' is a motto among Mormons that is taught to children and used by members of the church as a reminder to make choices that will help an individual to live righteously. The phrase is taken from a Mormon hymn which has that title. A very talented jeweler introduced a ring with a green escutcheon bearing the letters 'CTR' in silver. This ring became a symbol of our religious affliliation. It is so successful that we now produce them in a variety of designs over thirty languages.

This movement was founded by Joseph Smith in Upstate New York in the 1820s. During the 1830s and 1840s, Mormonism distinguished itself from traditional Protestantism. Mormonism today represents the new, non-Protestant faith taught by Smith in the 1840s. After Smith's death, most Mormons followed Brigham Young on his westward journey to the Utah Territory, calling themselves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Variations not a part of the LDS Church include Mormon fundamentalism, which seeks to maintain practices and doctrines such as polygamy that were abandoned by the LDS Church, and various other small independent denominations."

This is primarily a spiritual journey, in search of the memory of ancestors, but it also symbolizes the transition to adulthood.\n\nIt turns out that you have never performed this important ritual. As a leader, you must set an example to the younger generations, so you should venture in search of your spirituality through the Outback. However, this journey is not without danger, and some people think it would be wiser for you to abandon this project. A man as important as you can't risk his life."

Many ceremonies mimic the events of that era. Most of these ceremonies are sacred, although this is not the only purpose of the dance. It is primarily a time of sharing traditions within the community. Anyway, the Corroboree in one of our provinces has been particularly successful.

Yorùbá religious beliefs are part of Itan, the total complex of songs, histories, stories, and other cultural concepts which make up Yorùbá society. The Yorùbá hold that all human beings are expected to eventually become one in spirit with Olódùmarè (the divine creator and source of all energy). Daily life depends on proper alignment and knowledge of one's ori.\n\nOri literally means the head, but in spiritual matters it is taken to mean an inner portion of the soul that determines àyànmô (destiny) and success. Ase is the life-force that runs though all things, living and inanimate. The thoughts and actions of each person in the physical realm interact with all other living things, including the earth itself. Each person attempts to find their àyànmô in the spiritual realm. The Orishas, the divine viziers and manifestations of Olódùmarè, represent intermediary and guiding divinities."

They are still trying to understand why, but we know that we are simply blessed by the god of thunder Shango, who is the spiritual father of the twins in our nation.

Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, pastors and deacons. Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches, though some Baptists disavow this identity."
 hussitism_religion_desc: "The Hussites were a Christian movement following the teachings of Czech reformer Jan Hus, who became the best-known representative of the Bohemian Reformation and one of the forerunners of the Protestant Reformation. This predominantly religious movement was propelled by social issues and strengthened Czech national awareness. After the Council of Constance lured Jan Hus in with a letter of indemnity, then tried him for heresy and put him to death at the stake on 6 July 1415, the Hussites fought the Hussite Wars (1420–1434) for their religious and political cause."

Its adherents, the Mandaeans, revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enos, Noah, Shem, Aram and especially John the Baptist, but reject Abraham, Moses and Jesus. The Aramaic 'manda' means 'knowledge', as does Greek 'gnosis'. Mandaeans appear to have settled in northern Mesopotamia, but the religion has been practised primarily around the lower Karun, Euphrates and Tigris and the rivers that surround the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, part of southern Iraq and Khuzestan Province in Iran. Today, there are thought to be between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans worldwide."

It originated with the life and teachings of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908), who claimed to have fulfilled the prophecies of the world's reformer during the end times, who was to herald the eschaton as predicted in the traditions of various world religions and bring about, by peaceful means, the final triumph of Islam as per Islamic prophecy. He claimed that he was the Mujaddid (divine reformer) of the 14th Islamic century, the promised Messiah and Mahdi awaited by Muslims. The adherents of the Ahmadiyya movement are referred to as Ahmadi Muslims or simply Ahmadis."
 mutazila_religion_desc: "Mu'tazila is a school of Islamic theology based on reason and rational thought that flourished in the cities of Basra and Baghdad, both in present-day Iraq, during the 8th–10th centuries. The adherents of the Mu'tazili school—known in the English language as 'Mu'tazilites'—are best known for their denying the status of the Qur'an as uncreated and co-eternal with God, asserting that if the Quran is God's word, logically God 'must have preceded his own speech'. After the 10th century, the movement declined. It is viewed as heretical by some scholars in modern mainstream Islamic theology for its tendency to deny the Qur'an being eternal, and to allow for the possibility of free will and thus opposing the strict determinism of mainstream thought."
 shaivism_religion_desc: "Saivam or Shaivism or Saivism is one of the four most widely followed sects of Hinduism, which reveres the God Shiva as the Supreme Being. They believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is. Shaivism, like some of the other forms of Hinduism, spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, including Java, Bali, and parts of the Southeast Asian continent, including Cambodia. Shiva is sometimes depicted as the fierce God Bhairava. Saivists are more attracted to asceticism than adherents of other Hindu sects, and may be found wandering India with ashen faces performing self-purification rituals. They worship in the temple and practice yoga, striving to be one with Shiva within."
 shaktism_religion_desc: "Shaktism or Shaktidharma is a denomination of Hinduism that focuses worship upon Shakti or Devi – the Hindu Divine Mother – as the absolute, ultimate Godhead. It is, along with Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Smartism one of the primary schools of devotional Hinduism and is especially popular in Bengal and Assam. Shaktism regards Devi as the Supreme Brahman itself, with all other forms of divinity, considered to be merely her diverse manifestations. In the details of its philosophy and practice, Shaktism resembles Shaivism. However, Shaktas (practitioners of Shaktism) focus most or all worship on Shakti, as the dynamic feminine aspect of the Supreme Divine. Shiva, the masculine aspect of divinity, is considered solely transcendent, and his worship is usually relegated to an auxiliary role."
 imperialcult_religion_desc: "The Imperial cult of ancient Rome identified emperors and some members of their families with the divinely sanctioned authority of the Roman State. The framework for the Imperial cult was formulated during the early Principate of Augustus, and was rapidly established throughout the Empire and its provinces, with marked local variations in its reception and expression. As Roman society evolved, so did cult to emperors"
 numenism_religion_desc: "It is difficult to reconstruct early Roman religion which consisted of a mixture of native Latin, Etruscan, and Greek belief. Much of Etruscan religion and mythology became part of classical Roman culture, including the Roman pantheon. The Senate adopted key elements of their religion, which were perpetuated by haruspices (divination specialists) and noble Roman families who claimed Etruscan descent. Greek religion also impacted the Italian peninsula relatively early, adopted into the Etruscan system around 750 BC."
 neoplatonism_religion_desc: "In many ways, the mystical Neoplatonism of late antiquity represents the culmination of Greco-Roman religious thought. Drawing from traditional religious practice, mystery cults, orientalism, and the philosophical tradition, Neoplatonism (especially as formulated by Iamblichus) presented a final organized revival of traditional pagan practice in the Christian empire. The ritual aspect of Neoplatonism, theurgy, even served as the backdrop for Emperor Julian's revived paganism in AD 362, briefly gaining prominence akin to a state religion. Christianity ultimately reasserted itself as the dominant religion of the period, but this did little to lessen the impact of Neoplatonism on religious thought. The emanationist cosmology and divine hierarchies presented by Neoplatonism were taken up by Christian, Jewish, and Muslim theologians forming key components of later schools of mysticisms such as Kabbalah and Sufism. The rediscovery of Neoplatonic texts in the Renaissance would also inspire modern Hermetic and magic traditions."
 hermeticism_religion_desc: "Hermeticism, also called Hermetism, is a religious, philosophical, and esoteric tradition based primarily upon writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus (Thrice Great). These writings have greatly influenced the Western esoteric tradition and were considered to be of great importance during both the Renaissance and the Reformation. The tradition claims descent from a prisca theologia, a doctrine that affirms the existence of a single, true theology that is present in all religions and that was given by God to man in antiquity. Many Christian writers, including Lactantius, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Marsilio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Giordano Bruno, Campanella, Sir Thomas Browne, and Emerson, considered Hermes Trismegistus to be a wise pagan prophet who foresaw the coming of Christianity."
 atanodjuwaja_religion_desc: "The extent to which one must differentiate between Minoan and early Mycenaean religion is a difficult question. There is no doubt that Minoan culture would go on to influence the Greek world, and, as such, a degree of transmission is assumed. However, Minoan religion was not transmitted through its native language, and Minoan writing continues to remain largely undeciphered. Surviving Minoan iconography, in fact, more closely resembles the religions of the ancient Near East than those with Indo-European or Etruscan influence. However, the Minoans also appear to have practiced a matriarchal religion; primarily worshipping goddess. Although there is some evidence of male gods, depictions of Minoan goddesses vastly outnumber depictions of anything that could be considered a Minoan god. Several goddesses appear to be portrayed including a primary solar goddess (possibly linked to Athena), a mother goddess, a mistress of animals, protectors of cities and household, and underworld goddesses. Votive figures were often represented alongside serpents."
 dodecatheism_religion_desc: "Dodekatheism originated in and is practiced in Greece and in other countries. Leaders of the movement claimed in 2005 that there are as many as 2,000 adherents to the Hellenic tradition in Greece. Hellenic polytheists worship the ancient Greek Gods, including the Olympians, nature divinities, underworld deities (chthonic gods) and heroes. Both physical and spiritual ancestors are honored. It is primarily a devotional or votive religion, based on the exchange of gifts (offerings) for the gods blessings. The ethical convictions of modern Hellenic polytheists are often inspired by ancient Greek virtues such as reciprocity, hospitality, self-control and moderation."
 vedism_religion_desc: "The religion of the Vedic period was a historical predecessor of modern Hinduism, though significantly different from it. Some scholars have compared the level of difference between Vedism and modern Hinduism as similar to the level of difference between Temple Judaism and modern Christianity. The religion of the later Vedic period co-existed with local religions and was itself the product of a composite of the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian cultures and civilizations. Vedic religion was followed by the Upanishads which gradually evolved into Vedanta, which is regarded by some as the primary institution of modern Hinduism. However, aspects of the historical Vedic religion survived in corners of the Indian subcontinent such as Kerala, where the Nambudiri Brahmins continue the ancient Srauta rituals considered extinct in all other parts of India."
 freemasonry_religion_desc: "Freemasonry consists of fraternal organisations that trace their origins to the local fraternities of stonemasons, which from the end of the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. The degrees of freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Apprentice, Journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason. These are the degrees offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as Freemasons or Masons. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees."
 pajelanca_religion_desc: "Pajelanca (from the Tupi word pajé, a form of shaman) is a generic term applied to various manifestations of shamanism found amongst indigenous peoples of the Amazon Rainforest Basin. Although specifics differ between the various indigenous tribes, most traditions center around the use of plant extracts in order to enter trances, contact spiritual entities, or for healing purposes. The pajé, then, acts as both doctor and priest. Typically, this knowledge is passed down from generation to generation and the responsibility of the pajé as a whole falls to the tribe. Some Tupi believe that pajé have a direct link with the gods as well as the various powers and non-human beings (ancestor spirits of both humans and animals), and by extension have the power of prophecy."
 angakkunngurniq_religion_desc: "The Inuit practiced a form of shamanism based on animist principles. They believed that all things had a form of spirit, including humans, and that to some extent these spirits could be influenced by a pantheon of supernatural entities that could be appeased when one required some animal or inanimate thing to act in a certain way. The angakkuq of a community of Inuit was not the leader, but rather a sort of healer and counselor, who tended wounds and offered advice, as well as invoked the spirits to assist people in their lives. His or her role was to see, interpret, and exhort the subtle and unseen. Angakkuit were not trained; they were held to be born with the ability and recognized by the community as they approached adulthood."
 chiminigagua_religion_desc: "Unlike the theocratic empires of Mexico and Peru, the fledgling Muisca state had no stone pyramids, temples, or sculpture. In common with the religions of other American theocracies, however, that of the Muisca placed special emphasis on the adoration of the sun. In Muisca cosmology, the supreme deity, Chiminigagua, was equated with light. Myth recounts how, in the beginning, darkness and silence reigned over a sterile world. Light existed only as the omniscient Chiminigagua within an impenetrable shell of clay. On the occasion of the first dawn, the god broke the shell and illuminated with beauty all that had previously been chaos. Complementing this dawn-creation myth is the legend of Bachue, fecund mother and matrilineal deity, who emerged from the waters to give birth to the people of the Muisca realm. The most notable example of Muisca religious practice to influence contemporary popular culture is perhaps the legend of El Dorado. El Dorado literally means 'the gilded one' in Spanish. The Zipa used to offer gold and other treasures to the Guatavita goddess. To do so, the Zipa covered himself with gold. This tradition was well-known outside the Muisca Confederation, as far as the Caribbean Sea. Imagined as a place, El Dorado became the kingdom of this legendary golden king."
 kachina_religion_desc: "A Kachina is a spirit being found in western Pueblo cosmology and religious practice, representing anything from a revered ancestor to an element, location, quality, natural phenomenon, or concept. Although not worshipped, kachina are viewed as powerful beings which, if given veneration and respect, can use their particular power for human good. Historically, the kachina religion predates European contact; however, it remains an open question among scholars as to whether the kachina religion was an indigenous creation or an import from Mesoamerica."
 mahoma_religion_desc: "Under the Calusa there was a standardized ritual cult, distinct from the Southern Cult, that was probably traditional and widely shared in South Florida. However, it is difficult to distinguish the political religiosity associated with state level worship and the traditional religion at the social bottom. The Calusa chief was understood as possessing special and traditional religious knowledge and held a council which may have included on more head priests."
 midewiwin_religion_desc: "The Midewiwin, or the Grand Medicine Society, is a secretive religion of the aboriginal groups of the Maritimes, New England, and Great Lakes regions in North America. Historians describe Midewiwin as a flexible, tenacious tradition that provided an institutional setting for the religious beliefs of the Ojibwe people. According to oral history, seven great Miigis (Iridescent Beings) appeared to the peoples in the Waabanakiing (Land of the Dawn) to teach them Midewiwin. One of them, the Thunderbird, was too powerful and forced to return to the ocean lest he kill the people in his presence. The other six Miigis remained to teach the people and each established the various clans, symbolized by animal, fish, or bird species. Other traditions, associate the founding of Midewiwin to Nanabozho or Mateguas, trickster figures commonly associated with the rabbit."
 orenda_religion_desc: "Iroquois religion is characterized by a dualistic belief in an all-powerful creator known as Hawenneyu, or Great Spirit, and his evil twin brother Hanegoategeh, or Evil-Minded. The Iroquois believe in the constant superintending care of the Great Spirit, yet knowledge of him is beyond human understanding. Honochenokeh, or Invisible Agents, are a series of intermediary lesser spirits which preside over individual objects or powers. The Iroquoian term Orenda, like mana, designates a power that is inherent in numerous objects of nature but that does not have essential personification or animistic elements. The ritual ceremonies practiced by the Iroquois tribes were systematic occurring in accordance to certain seasonal periods throughout the year. Festivals were led by Honundenont, or Keepers of the Faith, and most commonly occurred during important agricultural periods. Worship and thanks were given to the Great Spirit for protection and survival. Creation myths often involve the interplay between Hawenneyu and Hanegoategeh, as well as Atahensic, the Sky Woman. Hawenneyu was said to have planted a single maize plant in the body of his mother Atahensic. This plant was a gift to mankind. In many variants of the creation myth, Atahensic was a Sky Woman who fell to earth. She died in childbirth and her body fertilized the earth so that her granddaughters could grow many things. The Iroquois axis mundi existed as a form of Great Turtle who carried the world on the back of his shell."
 wakan_tanka_religion_desc: "In Sioux tradition, Wakan Tanka can be translated as the Great Spirit, or, perhaps more accurately, as the Great Mystery. The Sioux regard the universe as ultimately incomprehensible; life, growth, and death are mysterious and suggestive of powers difficult to understand. Since time itself does not embody notions of change and progress, nothing in the universe can be considered to be inevitable. This incomprehensibility and unpredictability of the universe, anything difficult to understand, is called wakan, which also connotes the animating force of the universe, the totality of which is Wakan Tanka. Wakan Tanka, then, can be understood as the sum total of the personified powers that brought all things into being; sometimes embodied as the Six Grandfathers."
 pohakantenna_religion_desc: "The religion of the Numic peoples of the Great Basin recognizes the central importance of power and energy; poha. Poha, as the central vivifying energy, has a great affinity for all living things. As water is the most vitally important component of living in the Basin, poha and water (paa) are closely linked. Poha is not understood to be static; it is dynamic and kinetic, underlying all aspects of the universe. As singing and dancing involve rhythmical movement not unlike the poha of the universe, both play a central role in controlling the flow of power. Large formal gatherings, such as the dancing circle, serve to concentrate poha in an area. Poha is also conferred by a spirit through a recurrent dream or vision. The individual can then use the power to benefit others, becoming a shaman (pohakanten), or for personal reasons; becoming a witch (dizipoha). Power in and of itself is merely a gift to man by one of the immortals, usually the ideal of an animal species, which has existed since the Timeless Age."
 southern_cult_religion_desc: "The major focus of Mississippian religion was the interconnectivity of all life, expressed predominantly through agriculture and extensive mortuary customs. Besides the use of platform mounds, a complex and elaborate system of iconography began to be expressed in the artifacts accompanying burials. Traditionally labeled as the Southern Death Cult, and in modern academia as the Southern Ceremonial Complex, this iconography can be seen in shell cups, copper plates, chipped and ground objects, stone statues, pottery, and more rarely in cave art. Besides a strong religious association, the Southern Cult represents a conflation of political, social, and economic aspects of Mississippian life."
 witran_mapu_religion_desc: "The spiritual belief of the Mapuche people is closely linked to the land and their natural environment from which the power of life emanates with the grace of a divine family known as Nguenechen, Elmapun, Elchen, and Ngunemapun, and which creates and sustains man and nature. The Mapuche people are guided by the machi, spiritual leaders (mainly women) who are the mediums of communication with the celestial family in order to maintain harmony and combat the malicious power of wekufe (evil). The Machi's supernatural power is complemented by the sacred kultrun drum they possess and play during their prayers and religious activities. The kultrun often depicts Mapuche cosmology; the earth divided by the four cardinal points. Modern Mapuche belief is highly syncretic incorporating elements from both Catholicism and Protestant movements."
 zemiism_religion_desc: "Indigenous Antillean religion, as recorded by late 15th and 16th century Spaniards, centered on a supreme creator god and a fertility goddess. The creator god was Yucahu Maorocoti, who governed the growth of cassava, the staple food of the islands, and the fertility goddess was Attabeira, who governed the moon, water, rivers, and seas. Religious worship centered on zemis, a term for both the gods themselves and for their physical representations, whether objects or drawings. Very small ceramic three-point zemis have been uncovered by archaeologists in the Lesser Antilles, as well as Colombia and Venezuela, dating back to 200 BC. Ancestral spirits were also highly honored, particularly those of chiefs. Bones or skulls might be incorporated into sculptural zemis. Ancestral remains would be housed in shrines and given offerings, such as food. Some zemis have been found accompanied by a small table or tray, which is believed to be a receptacle for hallucinogenic snuff called cohoba."
 sgaanaang_religion_desc: "The indigenous religious belief systems of the Pacific Northwest can be called animistic, whereby the natural world is animated by nature spirits which can influence the everyday lives of humans. These supernatural entities form relationships with lineage ancestors, becoming symbolically represented in the artistic tradition as crest animals. Cosmological notions find expression in complex oral traditions and knowledge of these and the animated natural world are still a vital component of modern belief. Of particular interest is the concept of the Transformer, usually embodied by the Raven or Coyote, who is considered the active earthly agent of the Creator."
 santeria_religion_desc: "Santería, (The Way of the Saints), also known as Lucumí, is the most common name given to a syncretic religious tradition of African origin that was developed in Cuba and then spread throughout Latin America and the United States. Santería was brought to Cuba by the people of the Yoruba nations of West Africa, who were enslaved in great numbers in the first decades of the 19th century. The name Santería derives from the correspondences made by some devotees between the Yoruba deities called orishas and the saints of Roman Catholic piety. As Santería developed from Yoruba theology, it is distinct from Voodoo and Palo, which developed from Fon and Bakongo theology respectively."
 heros_karabazmos_religion_desc: "Paleo-Balkan polytheism includes the religious practices of the Dacians, Thracians, and Illyrians. Due to a limited historical record, not much is known about the rituals and mythology of the Iron Age Balkans; however, elements can be gleaned from surviving statuary, neighboring Greek sources, and comparative studies. The mythology of the Illyrians is particularly unascertained, only known through mention of Illyrian deities on Roman period monuments. One notable cult, found throughout Thrace, Moesia, Illyria, and Scythia Minor is that of the Thracian Horseman. It is attested at Odessos by the Thracian name Heros Karabazmos and relates to an underworld deity usually depicted on funeral statues as a horseman slaying a beast with a spear."
 bird_figure_religion_desc: "The Vinca culture was a Neolithic archaeological culture in Southeastern Europe, dated between 5700-4500 BC. The culture is mainly distinguished by its settlement pattern and ritual behavior, maintaining a high degree of cultural uniformity through the long distance exchange of ritual items. Although there is evidence of potential proto-writing within Vinca culture, it is undecipherable. As such, details concerning Vinca belief must be inferred from archeological evidence; notably the abundance of ritual figurines."
 razana_religion_desc: "Approximately half of the country's population practice traditional religion, which tends to emphasize links between the living and the razana (ancestors). The veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the famadihana, whereby a deceased family member's remains may be exhumed to be periodically re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere. Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party, where food and rum are typically served and a hiragasy troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present. Consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to fady, taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. In addition, the Malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god, called Zanahary or Andriamanitra."
 amanaiism_religion_desc: "It is difficult to fully reconstruct the indigenous religious beliefs of the Berber people prior to the spread of Christianity and Islam into North Africa. As an Afro-Asiatic people, mythological and linguistic comparison with the Phoenician and Egyptian cultures is helpful as well as archeological evidence found throughout North Africa. However, the majority of written evidence concerning Berber religion comes from neighboring (particularly Greek and Egyptian) sources. Additionally, some ancient Berber beliefs continue to exist within modern Berber culture, albeit significantly altered."
 kemitism_religion_desc: "Kemetism (also Kemeticism, both from Egyptian kmt or Kemet, the native name of Ancient Egypt), also sometimes referred to as Neterism, Tameran Wicca, or Egyptian Neopaganism, is the contemporary revival of Ancient Egyptian religion and related expressions of religion in classical and late antiquity, emerging during the 1970s. There are several main groups, each of which take a different approach to their beliefs, ranging from eclectic to reconstructionistic. They include, but are not limited to"
 odinani_religion_desc: "The traditional religion of the Igbo people, Odinani, is an ancient and complex monotheistic religion, although there are many spirits which serve as part of the overall religion. In its most basic form, the Odinani religion recognizes one God, named Chukwu (among other similar names) in the Igbo language. Like in the Abrahamic religions, Chukwu created the universe and everything in it. This Supreme Being, Ikekaike, is neither an ancestor nor a spirit, both fundamental parts of the religion. While not a physical being, they influence humanity in ways unknown."
 amatongo_religion_desc: "Zulu indigenous belief is primarily one of ancestor worship. The Zulu pray to the amatongo, the venerated ancestors, and the spirits of the dead in general are understood to be responsible for the care of the living, the community's wealth and cattle, and the harmony in the kraal. The Amatongo are in charge of bringing correction and balance to the community and are as much present in the homestead as the living members of the lineage. Communion with the spirits of the ancestors is perhaps the largest part of traditional Zulu culture performed through the ritual sacrifice of cattle."
 bumuntu_religion_desc: "Luba religion shares many basic tenets with other African religions including the existence of a Universal Creator (Shakapanga), the afterlife and a communion between the living and the dead, and the observance of ethical conduct (Mwikadilo Muyampe) as an essential condition for being welcomed in the village of the ancestors after death. Three primary figures constitute the supernatural world in Luba cosmology"
 canaanite_religion_religion_desc_religion_desc: "Canaanite polytheism refers to the Ancient Semitic religions practiced in the Levant from at least the early Bronze Age through the first centuries of the common era. Notably, it was the religion practiced by the ancient Phoenicians who then disseminated it throughout their coastal colonies. Native Carthaginian religion is thus included within the broader heading of Canaanism. Central deities included"
 fat_roog_religion_desc: "The traditional Serer religion represents the original religious beliefs, practices, and teachings of the Serer people of Senegal in western Africa. The Serer people believe in a universal supreme deity called Roog as well as lesser ancestral and nature spirits known as pangol. The village shrine, or xérém, was the nucleus of communal identity before colonization. It represents the intersection of nature, the spirit realm, and humanity, symbolically bridging the gap between human space (dëkk) and wild nature (àll) and bringing the spirit powers into the inhabited village. This communion is also profoundly local as pacts are between spirits and specific human communities and continue to sustain these communities. On a larger scale, a federation of villages could be called together for collective ceremonies in moments of crisis."
 itan_religion_desc: "The Yorùbá religion comprises the indigenous religion of the Yorùbá people, centered in Southwestern Nigeria and the adjoining parts of Benin and Togo. Yorùbá religious beliefs are part of Itan, the total complex of songs, histories, stories, and other cultural concepts which make up Yorùbá society. The Yorùbá hold that all human beings are expected to eventually become one in spirit with Olódùmarè (the divine creator and source of all energy). Daily life depends on proper alignment and knowledge of one's ori. Ori literally means the head, but in spiritual matters it is taken to mean an inner portion of the soul that determines àyànmô (destiny) and success. Ase is the life-force that runs though all things, living and inanimate. The thoughts and actions of each person in the physical realm interact with all other living things, including the earth itself. Each person attempts to find their àyànmô in the spiritual realm. The Orishas, the divine viziers and manifestations of Olódùmarè, represent intermediary and guiding divinities."
 laiboni_religion_desc: "The Maasai believe in one God, whom they call Ngai. Ngai is neither male nor female, but contains characteristics of both. There are two primary manifestations of Ngai. The good and benevolent black god, Ngai Narok, who shows goodness in water, rain, cattle, and children, and the angry red god, Ngai Na-nyokie, representing destructive water and sickness. In the beginning, Ngai was one with the earth and owned all the cattle that lived on it. But when the earth and sky separated, Ngai was no longer among men. The cattle, though, needed the material sustenance of the earth, so, to prevent them from dying, Ngai sent the cattle down to the Maasai and told them to look after them. Cattle retain an important role in ritual occasions, such as initiation and marriage, where their sacrifice bridges the gap between man and god. Even the grass used to feed cattle retains a semi-sacred aura and is used for blessings and as a sign of peace."
 num_faith_religion_desc: "The religious belief systems of the Khoikhoi and San peoples (Khoisan) of South Africa represent two distinct but interrelated traditions. In everyday activities, the Khoisan believe that one deity is the supreme creator and maintainer of life and earthly elements. This supreme god is a good one and its goodness is the focus of rituals and sacrifices. Yet, Khoisan religion is also highly dualistic"
 nzambiism_religion_desc: "The indigenous religion of the Congo Basin represents a group of distinct but related traditional practices and cosmological concerns. Modern cosmology centers around Nzambi a Mpungu as supreme god and creator, although there is some debate regarding if Nzambi a Mpungu always held the position of supreme god or if it was a development in relation to the Christian God of Portuguese missionaries. Other categories include the bakulu (ancestors) and guardian spirits known as simbi."
 voodoo_religion_desc: "Vodun and its similarly named offshoot religions (Haitian Vodou, the Vudu of Puerto Rico, and Louisiana Voodoo) are primarily syncretic religions originating in West Africa and maintaining a strong foothold in the New World throughout the African diaspora. Vodun proper refers to an indigenous organized religion of coastal West Africa practiced by the Ewe, Kabye, Mina, and Fon people. It is distinct from the various traditional animistic religions found in the interior of West Africa away from the coast, and contains large elements of neighboring religions, such as traditional Yoruba theology."
 onyamesom_religion_desc: "The Ashanti believe in a pantheistic world of spirits, which pervade all matter - animate and inanimate - and control all actions and events. As unknowable and unapproachable, Nyame, the supreme god, is not worshipped in the traditional sense. He is approached through the ancestors and lesser spirits (abosom). However, even the abosom are understood as primarily utilitarian; they are beseeched and praised if they can provide good fortune, but can become the objects of contempt if they fail to do so."
 yazdanism_religion_desc: "Yazdânism is a neologism to denote a group of interrelated native Kurdish monotheistic religions"
 akattu_religion_desc: "Little is known about the indigenous religion of the Indus Valley Civilization. No religious buildings or temples have been identified, and most suppositions about sacrificial fires, cult objects, and deities rest on doubtful retrospective references from Hindu practices of many centuries later. Certain recovered figures have been interpreted as representative of an earth mother goddess. There is also the possibility of a bull cult reminiscent of Mesopotamia. The early period also supports the burial of the dead as opposed to cremation. Although one must be careful not to identify Indus and later Indian religions too closely, potential clues can still be drawn through comparative analysis."
 natib_quadish_religion_desc: "Natib Qadish is a modern polytheistic religion that venerates the ancient deities of Canaan and strives to understand the ancient cultural context and religious practices in which these deities were honored. Within Natib Qadish, there are various views, beliefs, approaches, and practices because much of the research is incomplete and scholarly theories differ widely."
 tjukurpa_religion_desc: "Tjukurpa is the Pitjantjatjara word for the Dreaming, a term within the animist creation narrative of indigenous Australians for a personal or group creation and for what may be understood as the timeless time of formative creation and perpetual creating. It is known in Yankunytjatjara as Wapar. The Dreaming can be seen as an embodiment of creation, which gives meaning to everything. It establishes the rules governing relationships between the people, the land and all things for Aboriginal people."
 manaism_religion_desc: "Indigenous Polynesian religion represents a group of distinct but related belief systems that exists across the various ethnic groups of the Polynesian Triangle. These belief systems often share many fundamental concepts, such as mana and tapu, and feature similar mythic cycles. The religion is polytheistic, believing in many deities, as well as animistic; spirits are also found in non-human beings and objects such as animals, the waves, and the sky. In Hawaii, the gods are known as atua, and the four most prominent deities, the ka ha, were Kane (the creator), Ku (war), Lono (agriculture), and Kanaloa (the sea). Cognates of these gods (Tane, Tu, Rongo, Tangaroa, respectively), held similar positions of prominence throughout the East Polynesian groups."
 puata_tupuna_religion_desc: "Eastern Polynesian religious practice is a testament to the increasingly more complex chiefdoms that began to develop within the Polynesian triangle. It can be understood as subset of larger Polynesia belief; distinct but related systems that share many fundamental concepts, such as mana (spiritual force) and tapu (spiritual restriction), and feature similar mythic cycles. Polynesian religion is polytheistic, believing in many deities, as well as animistic; spirits are also found in non-human beings and objects such as animals, the waves, and the sky."
 yevon_religion_desc: "In Final Fantasy X, the people of Spira follow the Teachings of Yevon. The faith is named after Yu Yevon, a summoner who lived in Zanarkand one thousand years ago. Nearly all the peoples of Spira follow the teachings of Yevon, including the Ronso and the Guado (converted during High Summoner Braska's Calm by Jyscal Guado and Kelk Ronso). The Al Bhed are an exception and are viewed as heretics by the autocracy for their use of machina, a practice strictly forbidden by the church. As for the Hypello, whether or not they follow Yevon's teachings is never explored. The Yevon church draws inspiration from real-world religions, such as Shintoism (practices and temples), Buddhism (iconography and ritualistic disciplines), Islam (pilgrimages) and Catholicism (hierarchical structure and rigid doctrine)."
 crystal_religion_desc: "Throughout the Final Fantasy series, there have been instances of Gods, Goddesses and other divine beings. Divine beings often play an active part in the storyline, usually in the role of villain, but on other occasions, the Gods and Goddesses are only part of the game's mythology and background. They are mostly manifesting themwelves though crystals. Crystals have power over natural phenomena, and function as a powerful source of magical energy."
 okami_religion_desc: "Okami is an action-adventure video game developed by Clover Studio and published by Capcom. Set sometime in classical Japanese history, the game combines several Japanese myths, legends and folklore to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the Shinto sun goddess, named Amaterasu, who took the form of a white wolf.

They got relegated in Antarctica for obscure reasons, although many legends make mention of the gift of this continent which was far for them to live in peace and harmony, in rather awful climatic conditions but at least no one else would disturb them. However, the time has come for penguins to be venerated once again. After all, there is nothing more beautiful than cute fluffy penguin chick waddling on the ice!"
 disney_religion_desc: "Since the first adventures of Mickey Mouse in 1928, the Disney universe makes everyone dream. Over a hundred animated films were made, not including cartoons made for television. This universe continues to grow slowly but surely... And what if the Happiest place on Earth became a religion of its own? What if people decided to worship the most famous mouse in the world?"
 wicca_religion_desc: "Wicca, also termed Pagan Witchcraft, is a contemporary Pagan new religious movement. It was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and was introduced to the public in 1954 by Gerald Gardner, a retired British civil servant. Wicca draws upon a diverse set of ancient pagan and 20th century hermetic motifs for its theological structure and ritual practice. Wicca has no central authority. There are many variations on the core structure, and the religion grows and evolves over time. It is divided into a number of diverse lineages, sects and denominations, referred to as traditions, each with its own organizational structure and level of centralisation."
 jainko_religion_desc: "The mythology of the ancient Basques largely did not survive the arrival of Christianity in the Basque Country between the 4th and 12th century AD. Most of what is known about elements of this original belief system is based on the analysis of legends, the study of place names and scant historical references to pagan rituals practised by the Basques. One main figure of this belief system was the female character of Mari. According to legends collected in the area of Ataun, the other main figure was her consort Sugaar. However, due to the scarcity of the material it is difficult to say if this would have been the central pair of the Basque pantheon. Based on the attributes ascribed to these mythological creatures, this would be considered a chthonic religion as all its characters dwell on earth or below it, with the sky seen mostly as an empty corridor through which the divinities pass."
 armenian_religion_desc: "The Armenian symbol of eternity is one of the national symbols of Armenia. This is a common and easily observable element in Armenian architecture, from ancient Armenian steles to khachkars. If Armenia was one of the first nations to convert to Christianity (several decades before Byzantium), the previous religion of the country was influenced by hellenism, adapting a part of the pantheon of the ancient Greeks."
 byeri_religion_desc: "Bwiti, or Byeri, is a spiritual discipline of the forest-dwelling Babongo and Mitsogo peoples of Gabon (where it is recognized as one of three official religions) and by the Fang people of Gabon and Cameroon. Modern Bwiti incorporates animism, ancestor worship, and Christianity into a syncretistic belief system. Bwiti practitioners use the psychedelic, dissociative root bark of the Tabernanthe iboga plant, specially cultivated for the religion, to promote radical spiritual growth, to stabilize community and family structure, to meet religious requirements, and to resolve pathological problems. The root bark has been consumed for hundreds of years in a Bwiti rite of passage ceremony, as well as in initiation rites and acts of healing. The experience yields complex visions and insights anticipated to be valuable to the initiate and the chapel."
 moai_religion_desc: "Moai, or mo‘ai, are monolithic human figures carved by the Rapa Nui people on the Chilean Polynesian island of Easter Island. Nearly half are still at Rano Raraku, the main moai quarry, but hundreds were transported from there and set on stone platforms called ahu around the island's perimeter. Almost all moai have overly large heads three-eighths the size of the whole statue. The moai are chiefly the living faces (aringa ora) of deified ancestors (aringa ora ata tepuna). The statues still gazed inland across their clan lands when Europeans first visited the island, but most were cast down during later conflicts between clans."
 imohag_religion_desc: "Before the arrival of Islam, the Tuareg people had a mythology of their own. Anigouran was one of their main deities. He appears in many stories transmitted by oral tradition. Anigouran is characterized by its exceptional intelligence and his taste for riddles. He is credited with the invention of tifinagh, the Tuareg alphabet, and scriptures using this alphabet were engraved on the rocks of the Air mountains."
 wakanda_religion_desc: "The Osage religion was pantheistic. All life forms and changes in the universe were the product of a single mysterious life-giving force called  Wa-kon-tah.  Humans were merely one manifestation of Wa-kon-tah. Clans were totemic, in that the members of a particular clan were more closely associated or linked to some manifestation of Wa-kon-tah than others. The Osage never claimed to fully understand this force and how it worked. There were spirits, and through visions humans communicated with them and gained their support. Some humans could turn themselves into animals. Power derived from supernatural knowledge was neither good nor evil."
 nazca_religion_desc: "Archaeologists, ethnologists, and anthropologists have studied the ancient Nazca culture to try to determine the purpose of the ancient geoglyphs located in southern Peru. One hypothesis is that the Nazca people created them to be seen by their gods in the sky. Some advanced a purpose related to astronomy and cosmology"
 moism_religion_desc: "Mo or Moism, occasionally called Zhuang Shigongism, is the religion of most Zhuang people, the largest ethnic minority of China. It has a large presence in Guangxi. While it has a supreme god, the creator Bu Luotuo, numerous other deities are venerated as well. It has a three-element-theory (sky, earth and water). Mo is animistic, teaching that spirits are present in everything. Mo developed from prehistoric beliefs of the Zhuang people; it also has similarities to Chinese folk religion, and has developed similar doctrines to Buddhism and Taoism, in the process of competition with the influence of these religions on Zhuang culture. The Cultural Revolution of China weakened Mo, though the religion has undergone a revival since the 1980s. Moism varies from region to region."

 jediism_religion_desc: "Jediism (or Jedism), is a nontheistic religious movement mainly based on the depiction of the Jedi in Star Wars media. Jediism attracted public attention in 2001 when a number of people recorded their religion as Jedi on national censuses, although most such submissions were thought to be protests or jokes. Although followers of Jediism acknowledge the influence of Star Wars on their religion, by following the moral and spiritual codes demonstrated by the fictional Jedi, they also insist their path is different from that of the fictional characters and that Jediism does not focus on the myth and fiction found in Star Wars. The Jedi follow the 16 teachings, which are based on the presentation of the fictional Jedi, as well as 21 maxims."

 XIN_DYNASTY_NAME: "The Xin Dynasty"
 XIN_DYNASTY_DESC: "Wang Mang, leading member of the influential Wang clan, takes advantage of the weakened Western Han dynasty following the death of Emperor Wu of Han and seizes the celestial throne for himself, establishing the Xin dynasty and modeling his rule after the old Western Zhou dynasty in an attempt to boost his legitimacy.

 TRAJAN_OPTIMUS_PRINCEPS_NAME: "Trajan, the Optimus Princeps"
 TRAJAN_OPTIMUS_PRINCEPS_DESC: "Emperor Trajan ascended the throne of the Roman Empire and was named ‘optimus princeps,’ or ‘best ruler,’ by the Roman Senate for his moderate rule and his appeal to the senatorial class. Having subjugated the Dacians, in 113 Trajan then turned against the Parthian Empire, the very same Parthians that had killed Crassus and defeated Mark Antony. By 116, Trajan would annex Mesopotamia, reigning over the Roman Empire at its greatest extent in history. However, in 115 the Kitos War broke out, a large scale Jewish revolt against Rome rule that would lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths, and the revolt has now spiraled out of control. Will the Roman Empire and its Optimus Princeps be able to retain its new Mesopotamian holdings with trouble in Judea?"
 UPHEAVAL_FIVE_BARBARIANS_NAME: "Uprising of the Five Barbarians"
 UPHEAVAL_FIVE_BARBARIANS_DESC: "In 280, the Jin dynasty united the lands of China after almost a century of civil war and bloodshed following the fall of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. However, after the death of its founder Emperor Wu of Jin the empire was devastated internally by the War of the Eight Princes. Amidst the chaos, the tribes known as the Five Barbarians invaded from the north and established their own sinicized kingdoms in northern China. To make matters worse, in 311 the Jin capital of Luoyang was sacked and Emperor Huai of Jin was captured and executed by the forces of Han Zhao; only five years later in 316, the Han Zhao sacked the new Jin capital of Chang’an and executed Emperor Min of Jin. With the Jin dynasty in retreat, perhaps the so-called barbarians can become the next bearers of the mandate of heaven."
 DEATH_OF_CLOVIS_NAME: "The Death of Clovis"
 DEATH_OF_CLOVIS_DESC: "Clovis I, the first ruler to unite all of the Franks and the founder of the Merovingian dynasty, dies in 511, and his lands are partitioned between his four sons. This division created the Kingdoms of Rheims, Orléans, Paris and Soissons, laying the foundation for the realms of Austrasia and Neustria, which would go on to become bitter rivals across generations. Thus, the death of a great unifier would set the precedent of disunity, a precedent that would define the political landscape of the Franks for generations. Meanwhile, to the south, another great unifier continues to pursue his ambitions - Theoderic the Great of the Ostrogoths acquires all of the Visigothic Kingdom, uniting the Goths under a single ruler and reigns over a vast empire from Italia to Hispania."

To the north, the Zhou and Qi dynasties have replaced the Northern Wei, led by rulers of Xianbei descent. In the steppes above China, the Gokturks under the Khagan Mugan have expanded into a great empire, driving the Avars towards the Danube."
 FALL_OF_SUI_NAME: "Fall of the Sui"
 FALL_OF_SUI_DESC: "The Sui dynasty unified China after over two centuries of disunity and conflict between warring states. However, the Sui led a disastrous campaign against the Goguryeo kingdom of Korea - faith in the empire was so poor that men would break their limbs to avoid conscription when rebellions erupted, and the short-lived Sui empire soon collapsed, the lands of the Middle Kingdom falling into chaos once more. However, among the various rival factions that emerged to seize power, former Sui official Li Yuan manages to seize large swathes of land in a short amount of time, declaring the Tang dynasty and becoming a likely inheritor of the Mandate of Heaven. Meanwhile, the Sui dynasty survives as a puppet in Luoyang, surrounded by rebel kingdoms and empires."

The Empress declares a new Zhou dynasty, claiming descendance from the ancient Zhou dynasty of old that had succeeded the Shang. A patron of Buddhism and Daoism, she named herself the Sage Mother. Empress Wu would go on to become one of the most well-known rulers in Chinese history due to her strong leadership and able governance, placing China once more on the world stage during her short-lived Zhou dynasty."
 BATTLE_OF_TOURS_NAME: "Battle of Tours"
 BATTLE_OF_TOURS_DESC: "The Umayyad Caliphate, having conquered Hispania from the Visigoths and reaching its territorial height, marches against the Franks at Tours.

However, the Kingdom of the Franks under Charles Martel would historically go on to defeat the invading force. To the east, the Tang empire of China continues to expand west and nearly directly borders the Caliphate, while the empire of Ghana in Africa establishes trade networks with north Africa and meets the Islamic world through its use of camels in the trans-Saharan trade."
 ABBASID_REVOLUTION_NAME: "Abbasid Revolution"
 ABBASID_REVOLUTION_DESC: "Six years after the Abbasids successfully take control of the Caliphate from the Umayyads, Caliph Al-Mansur succeeds his brother and stabilizes the empire, later going on to build the foundations for the new capital of Baghdad. In the west, the Umayyad dynast Abd al-Rahman I seizes control of Córdoba from its emir Yusuf al-Fihri, restoring Umayyad rule in al-Andalus. In Tunisia, Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri, having gained independence from the Caliphs, is assassinated by his brother Ilyas; however, Abd al-Rahman’s son Habib avenges his father, slaying Ilyas himself in single combat and taking the throne of Ifriqiya. In India, the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty fends off the Abbasid invasions. To the south, the Elichpur clan has overthrown the Chalukyas, establishing the Rashtrakuta dynasty. Also bordering the Abbasids are the Zunbils of Zabulistan, who continue to survive, preserving their unique faith as followers of the sun god Zun."

The Samanids and Saffarids along with the Sajids in Azerbaijan would contribute to a renaissance of Iranian culture, promoting Persian culture and arts to a high degree while also patronizing Arabic. However, the Samanids would also continue to be attacked by the Kara-Khanids in the north. The militaristic Caliph Al-Mu'tadid rules the Abbasid Caliphate, continuing to struggle with the Caliphate’s neighbors for control as the most militarily-active Caliph in Abbasid history. His heir Al-Muktafi would become Caliph three years later and go on to reincorporate Syria and Egypt into the empire by defeating the Tulunids. To the west, Leo VI the Wise rules the Byzantine Empire, flanked by Simeon I of Bulgaria, who had defeated Leo six years earlier and would go on to raise the status of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church to a patriarchate."

Meanwhile, Li Jing rules in the south over the dynasty of the Southern Tang, who claim themselves to be the true, direct successors of the previously-fallen Tang empire. To the far north, the Khitan Liao dynasty rules a vast empire and looks upon the lands of the Chinese Central Plains to the south with ambitious eyes. The Song would historically go on to unite the Chinese heartland and usher in a new golden age of science, culture and innovation, while the Tanguts in the northwest would go on to found the Western Xia dynasty."
 EMPIRES_OF_INDIA_NAME: "Empires of India"
 EMPIRES_OF_INDIA_DESC: "The Ghaznavids reach its greatest extent under Mahmud, expanding into India across the Indus River, marking a notable turning point as the Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religions, having coexisted in India for over a millenia, are challenged by the introduction of the new religion of Islam.

Having lost faith in their ruler, Mas’ud’s own army overthrew him and replaced him with his brother Muhummad, who killed Mas’ud. Muhammad’s reign was short-lived, however; Mawdud, the son of Mas’ud, waged war to avenge his father and killed Muhummad, seizing the Ghazni throne. With the Ghaznavids in turmoil, the victorious Tughril now turns west in pursuit of new ambitions in Persia, allied with his nephew Qavurt, the new Seljuk governor of Kerman.

Historically, Ashikaga Takauji would become discontent with Go-Daigo’s rule and, after crushing a rebellion against the emperor, would instead turn against the Emperor and establish his own shogunate in Kyoto. This Kenmu Restoration would be the last time the emperor possessed real power until the Meiji Restoration over five centuries later in 1868."

Meanwhile, the Byzantine Empire had recovered the lands of Thessalonica as a result of the Treaty of Gallipoli in 1403; thus, the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos now seeks to further exploit Ottoman weakness in the hopes of restoring the territories and glory of the empire.

However, some people used these techniques to increase drastically their production, at the detriment of quality. The market has been flooded with pearls, and their prices dropped considerably."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT18: "Ok."
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME19: "Giant Pearl"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC19: "During a trip, a fisherman found an oyster with a pearl of an extraordinary size. This is the largest pearl ever found by man. Of course, there is no way to wear ir around the neck, or to make a crown out of it. This giant pearl became a museum piece that arouses much admiration. Many people are discovering pearls this way, and not surprisingly, many women ask their husbands to offer them one -or even several- for their birthday..."

 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME20: "The Amber Road"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC20: "The Amber Road is, with the Tin Road, one of the most important trade routes of classical antiquity. This road connects the Baltic Sea, where are almost all the amber reserves, to the Mediterranean Sea. Amber was highly sought by the Egyptians, the Greeks and the Phoenicians; Romans perpetuated this tradition. Cheaper than gold for a similar luster, jewelers were fighting over this wonder of nature."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT20: "Ok."
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME21: "Fossilized Mosquitoes"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC21: "Amber is fossilized resin, which sometimes traps animals or plants; these organisms then travel through time in perfect condition. Actually, a few mosquitoes from the Jurassic Period have been found in Central America. One of them still has blood in his abdomen. Researchers were able to collect the blood, and found some dinosaur DNA. By finding other fossilized mosquitoes, it would even be possible to recreate some species, millions of years after their extinction. As a consequence, amber becomes one of the most sought after gems."

 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME23: "Thanksgiving"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC23: "Historically, Thanksgiving is a day of celebration in European peasant societies, where God is thanked for the good things he has achieved during the year. The tradition has crossed the Atlantic to celebrate the harvests in the New World. In order to celebrate particularly abundant harvests, one of the colonies decided to share their meal with the chief of the nearby native tribe, who came with cranberries as a present. This meal has become an opportunity to celebrate and be together, despite our differences. This tradition continues today."

 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME24: "Clacissism"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC24: "Classicism is a cultural and artistic movement that has developed in Europe. As a direct consequence of the Renaissance, it is defined by a set of values and criteria that develops an aesthetic based on a quest for perfection. Art is mainly inspired by the achievements of Antiquity. The marble is once again considered as a noble material, entering into the composition of numerous monuments and constructions."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT24: "Fantastic!"
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME25: "Colonization of the New World"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC25: "Thousands of settlers are now rushing through the raging oceans, in search of a better life in the New World. The lands to colonize are vast, but the infrastructures are non-existent. These pioneers do their best to settle down, and build entire villages with wood gathered from the surrounding forests. Lumberjacks and carpenters are now among the most requested occupations, and this has a huge impact on the price of wood. The wood industry has never been so successful."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT25: "Maybe we should send over some firefighters as well. Just in case."
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME26: "Decrease in Demand for Firewood"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC26: "The wood industry is not what it used to be. Industrialization has brought coal into households and factories, and the development of electricity means that firewood is less and less in demand. On the other hand, voices are beginning to rise in favor of forest protection. We must therefore expect a steep drop in the price of wood for the coming years."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT26: "I understand"
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME27: "Great Fire"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC27: "A huge fire occurred in one of the towns of the country. All the intrastructures have been destroyed by flames, and hundreds of people died. While most cities are immune to such atrocious events, this is not the case for small towns and villages, since most of them only have wooden houses. This devastating fire makes it clear that timber should be abandoned in favor of stronger materials, such as stone or brick."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT27: "This is appalling..."
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME28: "Noah's Ark"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC28: "This started as a rumor, but the news is now confirmed. The remains of what appears to be a huge wooden arch have been found in the mountains of the Near East. Theologians are formal. These remains are the foundations of Noah's Ark, a ship built on God's command to save Noah, his family and a couple from each species from the Flood about to happen. Of course, this news made a lot of people smile; but surprisingly, the demand for timber has never been stronger. Would people fear the arrival of a new Flood? Especially since skeletons of animals have also been found on site. A couple of each species. Strange..."

 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC29: "A rich nobleman, jealous of a suitor who wanted to marry the woman he was in love with, had the idea of asking a jeweler to create a delicate ring with diamonds in the shape of his first initial. He offered this gift to the young woman, who immediately agreed to marry him. Love is a halo of mystery, but it seems that a jewel can charm any young lady in search of a husband - even if the latter has a repulsive look. After all, as long as his wallet is well stocked... Anyway! This jewel, called "

 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME30: "The Democratization of Jewelry"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC30: "The Industrial Revolution and the emergence of mass production have made accessible products which used to be considered as luxurious. This is the case of jewelery. Formerly reserved for nobles and royalty because of its prohibitive cost, jewels are now a symbol of luxury accessible to the petty bourgeoisie, and even to those able to make serious savings. There are more and more jewelry stores in the big cities and they offer accessories for every budget and need."

 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC31: "Tired of having to recreate his mod from scratch every time Paradox decides to add a new update to Europa Universalis IV, mod genius Challenger decided to make a complete overhaul of his mod. This news angered the mod community, until they realized how smooth and bugless the game seems to be now (even if there are still bugs, hey, no one is perfect). As a consequence, users are eager to play more and more, which results in the acquisition of better computers."

 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME32: "Europeans Dicovered Potatoes"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC32: "Potatoes have been grown in South America for millennia. The Incas even venerated Axomama, goddess of the potato. When the first Europeans arrived in the Peruvian region, they were very surprised by these tubers, which the explorers brought back to Europe aboard their galleons. Adapting very well to European soils, the potato quickly sets out to conquer the Old Continent."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT32: "Excellent!"
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME33: "Fries"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC33: "The origin of the fries remains controversial. Its name comes from 'fried potatoes', later reduced to the simple term 'fries'. Over time, fries have become the main way to cook potatoes, becoming one of the favorite foods of people of all ages and all walks of life."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT33: "Yummy!"
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME34: "Irish Potato Famine"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC34: "The potato crisis is the name given to a major famine that has been triggered by decades of political instability, inappropriate farming methods and the appearance of late blight, a parasite that almost completely wiped out local potato crops, which was staple food for many peasants. This famine decimated the whole nation, but also impacted the entire continent. In the absence of a treatment, late blight spread across the land, making potatoes unfit for consumption."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT34: "This is terrible..."
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME35: "Vulcanization"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC35: "Vulcanization is a chemical process whose name comes from the Roman god Vulcan. The process involves incorporating a vulcanizing agent (essentially sulfur) into a crude elastomer to form, after firing, bridges between the molecular chains. This operation makes the material more elastic instead of plastic. This is the first major discovery that has allowed the use of rubber in the industry."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT35: "Fantastic!"
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME36: "Rubber Boots"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC36: "Thanks to the Industrial Revolution, the means of production are changing. It is also a time when many scientific discoveries are made. After discovering that rubber dissolved in a solvent has a high waterproofing value, rubber starts to be used in the industry, but into in the composition of goods. The invention of rubber boots is a real innovation, bringing benefits to both the military and civilians."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT36: "Excellent!"
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME37: "Rubber Tires"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC37: "After a first failure, the rubber tire was destined to disappear. However, its use has proved very effective for bicycles. A new tire system with inner tube has then been put in place. Even more efficient, they greatly increased the performance of the first racing cyclists in history. Very quickly, the car industy took possession of the invention. The first rubber-tired cars have been designed, and the tire became one of the essential elements for any mass-produced vehicle. Rubber has become a key element for the economic growth of the automotive sector."

 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME38: "Public Lighting"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC38: "The first modern uses of natural gas appear with public lighting. The establishment of the first lanterns had been done in Paris around 1667. During the following century, oil replaced candles with double wicks. However, lighting gas, discovered a few decades ago, is more effective than oil. The lanterns of the main cities of the world are slowly adopting this new process. Gas lighting will continue until the democratization of electricity, a few decades later."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT38: "Let there be light!"
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME39: "Pipelines"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC39: "Natural gas is extracted in places that can be very far from urban centers. Pipes are then built to transport the gas in the cities. Inspired by the techniques of the Romans, who had built many pipes in wood or terracotta for the transport of water, the first modern pipelines are made possible thanks to advances in metallurgy, which now allows the transport of materials under pressure. These pipes will inspire a few years later larger pipelines, meant to transport oil to refineries."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT39: "Excellent!"
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME40: "Liquefied Natural Gas"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC40: "Liquefied natural gas (abbreviated as LNG) is a commercial grade natural gas condensed in a liquid state. It is mainly used as a means of transporting natural gas from producing countries to consuming countries by sea. It is also used as fuel for ships and land vehicles. Because of its slightly lower toxicity, its combustion is less polluting than that of other fossil energies. As a consequence, natural gas is becoming a cheaper alternative to coal, whose reserves are dwindling day by day."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT40: "Interesting."
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME41: "The Encyclopedia"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC41: "The Encyclopedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts, is the symbol of the Age of Enlightenment. It is one of the first encyclopedias, gathering for the first tima mass amounts of knowledge, calling into question many ideas received from the Middle Ages. Volumes have been written over a long period, under the direction of the greatest scholars of society. The Encyclopedia was printed at 4,255 copies, which is a very big quantity at a time when the usual circulation of books was three times smaller. The Encyclopedia has been widely distributed abroad, supporting the ideas of the Enlightenment to North America, precipitating the American Revolution."

 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC42: "A paperback book is supposed to be small enough to fit in a pocket has has a relatively low price, in return for a lower quality. Most often, these are reprints of books that have already had significant success in their original format. This is a real revolution in the world of printing and bookstores.

 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC43: "While she was on a crowded train, a novelist had the idea of a character going to a school of witchcraft. A few years later, the first adventures of the young Harry Potter are published. The success is immediate among young readers, but the book exceeds all expectations, and also interests adults. Although media arts have seriously damaged the book industry, the pleasure of reading has been rediscovered by the population. The last volume of the adventures of the Boy Who Lived became the best-selling book in history... and gave many ideas to writers who now all want to become the next J.K. Rowling."

 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME44: "Aluminum Smelting"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC44: "Attempts to produce aluminium metal date back to the 18th century. Since its production was extremely expensive, the demand for aluminium remained low. An engineer found a way to smelt aluminum, by extracting aluminium from its oxide, alumina. A large amount of carbon is also used in this process, resulting in significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. With that process, aluminum wire and foil can be produced. Modern production has started, and aluminium has become a symbol of the future."
 cpbm_prices.EVTOPT44: "Excellent!"
 cpbm_prices.EVTNAME45: "Aluminum Can"
 cpbm_prices.EVTDESC45: "Aluminum became very important in military and research. It also has become a part of everyday lives, being an essential component of houseware. Someone had the idea of developing a container for packaging made primarily of aluminum. It is now commonly used for foods and beverages such as milk and soup, but also for products such as oil, chemicals, and other liquids. Global production of the aluminum can already exceed one billion units a year, and constitutes the biggest single use of aluminum globally."
