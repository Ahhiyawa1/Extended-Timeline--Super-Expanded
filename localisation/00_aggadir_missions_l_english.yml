 The Rogue Punic Remnant_title: "The Rogue Punic Remnant"
 The Rogue Punic Remnant_desc: "Aggadir is no ordinary city, but a survivor of the disastrous Punic Wars, a defiant symbol of the people who refused to bow completely to Roman rule. When Carthage burned, many believed that was the end of our history. But here, on the fringes of the world, we are proof that our story did not end with the fall of the great city. As the Roman soldiers salted the fields of Carthage, thinking they were extinguishing our legacy forever, some among us sailed west, past the Pillars of Hercules, to this distant shore. We founded Aggadir, hidden from the grasp of the Republic, and in this isolated corner of the world, we persisted while others faded. The Romans see us now as nothing more than a minor trading outpost—a curiosity nestled on the edge of their maps. But what they do not realize is that this city stands as a testament to our resilience and strength. Here, we speak the same tongue as Hannibal once did, worship the same gods, and uphold the same traditions that they tried to erase. We are living proof that no amount of destruction can wipe away a people’s will to survive. For nearly two centuries, we have observed the rise of the Principate, the consolidation of Roman power, and their relentless expansion across the known world. While the legions marched and provinces were annexed, we remained independent, quietly gathering wealth and influence. Our merchant fleets plied the waters of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, establishing connections with the tribes of Iberia, Mauretania, and beyond. We did not need walls of stone to protect us, but rather our shrewdness and diplomacy, bartering and trading to stay out of Rome’s gaze. But mere survival is not enough. To continue as we have, huddled in the shadow of Rome, would dishonor the legacy of those who fled with us—those who dared to build something anew. It is time for Aggadir to become more than a backwater settlement, more than a hidden gem of trade. We must grow bolder, richer, and more influential than ever before. Our ships will carry not only goods but the memory of who we are. Our traders will speak our story in every market and port from Mauretania to Gaul, from Iberia to the distant shores of Britannia. Our coins, stamped with Punic symbols, will spread across the world, a silent reminder that we are still here, flourishing on our own terms. Let Rome turn its gaze elsewhere. Let them underestimate us. For every deal struck, every alliance made, every new city state we encounter, Aggadir’s reputation will grow. We are not remnants. We are not survivors. We are the inheritors of a proud past, a people who refuse to let their history be rewritten by conquerors. In time, when our power is undeniable, even the Romans will have to acknowledge Aggadir as a force that cannot be brushed aside—a shining beacon of what remains of the Punic world, burning brighter with each passing year. It is our destiny to not just endure, but to rise again. To see the name of Aggadir whispered with the same respect and awe once reserved for Carthage. Our people’s story did not end in flames; it continues here, and it is time we wrote the next chapter!"
