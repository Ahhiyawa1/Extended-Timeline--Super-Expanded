daoism_religion_desc:0 "Daoism believes that one must live in harmony with the Dao, roughly translated as the 'Way.' Rejecting the unnatural aspects of government and society, Daoists believe in harmony with nature. Their desire to become closer with the natural world around them led many Daoists to become astrologists and alchemists, with the latter seeking the elixir of immortality. Despite its aversion to man-made institutions, Daoism has nonetheless influenced politics, governance and warfare in states across East Asia since it first emerged among the Chinese schools of thought during the Warring States period."

In the Roman Empire, worship began in the form of a mystery cult, becoming popular among generals and aristocrats in Roman society. Thus, this dynamic identity of Mithra has resulted in his appeal across religious and cultural lines, with Zoroastrians adopting Mithra as a fire and warrior yazata second only to Ahura Mazda."

Contrary to Mazdayan Zoroastrians, Zurvanists do not believe in total human free will, believing Time and Fate to be in control of human lives - humans may choose between good and evil, but it is ultimately predestined by Fate as to what an individual will do or have done to them. Zurvan is seen as a neutral deity, as Time holds both good and bad, and thus the dualism of good and evil is not as prominent in Zurvaniyyan Zoroastrianism as it is in Mazdayan Zoroastrianism."
