 hie_bos_imperial_law_desc: "Bosnia was put in a unique position: they might be underdeveloped but carry a rich history, especially a Roman one, having quite a good Roman administration still in place even after the slavic migrations of the fifth and sixth centuries. They also had a quite intimate relationship with the Byzantine empire which they were once part of. They called us barbarians but took care of us being their most western possession and one of their last remaining old roman possessions in the west. The more they declined the more we were entrusted with their ancient script and knowledge, safeguarding it for them. As long as neither the Turks nor the Franks got this, that was the deal. We would become one of the imperial vaults of knowledge like Crete and Cyprus. Thus arrived manuscripts of legal religious and technological significance that we studied in detail. Mostly we were entrusted with ancient legal documents."
 hie_bos_caves_kristjani: "Caves of the Kristjani"
 hie_bos_caves_kristjani_desc: "The Kristjani as they were called after how the bosniac language pronounces christian. Due to the influence of the catholics from the west and the orthodox church from the east this created a weird hybrid form of christianity. A mix between both catholic legalism and orthodoxy traditionalism. This caused some tension from both authorities on the one had the Serbs claiming they were heretics to orthodoxy and on the other you had the venetians calling the heretics catholics as well. After both a catholic synod and a orthodox synod both the pope and the patriarch agreed that the bosnian Kristjani church wasn't heretical. Some refused to agree with this, especially the Serbs and the austrians. But those that do recognize them for what they are love them. The unique thing about the Kristjani church is that they took certain aspects of the old church literally. For example the fact they made their churches and monasteries in the mountains or cliff sides like the christians of old. These things are nothing more or less special from any other churches and monasteries however this provides a place for the population to wither invasions and wars. Armies conquering abandoned farms and cities does way more harm to a foreign force during this time then one can imagine."
 hie_bos_stanak: "Stanak"
 hie_bos_stanak_desc: "The Stanak was in the beginning an assembly of the high landed nobility of bosnia. In which they would decide on the new king or queen of Bosnia settle disagreements between the nobility. However over time this would also start to include unlanded aristocratic families that held clerical or represented the burger class slowly where integrated into the Stanak. So it became an assembly of the estates via the aristocracy. Its process was quite paradoxical on the one hand it showed the centralisation of the state but on the other it proved the fracturing of the state via feudalism and the division of land canceling each other out. Centralization while decentralizing what it did do was giving a place for the king to address and control the estates and show his authority over them either via graces or tyranny."

But we managed an agreement, first with Ragusa called the charter of Ban Kulin, and later on with Venice as well. This gave us a way to trade our products of wax, gold, silver, wine, and untanned hides. We would bring them to the republics. They would sell them in our name internationally and we would receive both payment for the goods plus our trader would get commission depending on the amount of goods brought, funding both trader and state by trade."
 hie_bos_land_princes: "Land of the Princes"
 hie_bos_land_princes_desc: "In Byzantine fashion the land is not divided among dukes but among princes of the kingdom. Bosnia is a bridge between feudalism and the imperial government of the late roman empire and byzantium, combining feudalism with central law. Making it more like old europe then the rest of europe. While since the 11th century all of Europe has begun centralizing, the Bosnian kingdom has retained itself not as a state but as a coalition of princes under one crown. This makes vassals a necessity for the function of the kingdom itself. They are the foundation of our crown."
 hie_bos_guaranteed: "Guaranteed"
 hie_bos_guaranteed_desc: "Due to our strategic position a lot of others count on our survival. We have now been guaranteed by a greater state ever since our creation in the sixth century. First by byzantium then by hungary and later on by austria and the ottomans. It has become such an integral part of our diplomatic international strategy that we had established an office specifically for an attache from our protector.it was his responsibility to make sure the relationship with the protector was kept at a good level and that we kept our protectors."
 hie_bos_bosnian_freedom: "Bosnian freedom"
 hie_bos_bosnian_freedom_desc: "Or bosnian religious freedom we have always considered ourselves more christians than any specific flavor of it; the bosnian church or the Kristjani church hybrid proves this. However this doesn't mean that nothing else is welcome, in fact the Kristjani are a minority in bosnia. The majority of the population is divided among catholics in the wes and orthodox in the east. Now with the reformation in full swing many more churches have found homes in bosnia. And we have even extended this beyond christianity islam and the jewish faith are as welcome as all the rest."

The Byzantines were initially successful in the war, but the Bulgars ultimately emerged victorious and established their control over Thrace.

The Oblasts were divided into smaller administrative units called Okrugs, which were further divided into municipalities."

This law called articuli, was an attempt at a systematic codification of statute law. As it repeats a significant amount of previous legislation, it stands for tradition. As it contained changes or expansions of these older decisions in many points, it may be seen as an example for renewal. A major innovation was, however, that it was the first law of the kingdom of Hungary published in print."

Some already existed, but most were transcribed by Matthias Corvinus himself, who used Italian miniaturists such as Attavante Attavanti, Gherardo di Giovanni di Miniato or Francesco d'Antonio del Chierico, as well as founding his own school in the Hungarian capital."

This conflict would not only birth Transylvania as an independent region, people, and culture, but it would shape us. It shaped us to be ever skeptical of rulers because it's not a given they'll stick around. This also means that we've had to rely on ourselves mainly for everything. The “little war” lasted from 1500 all the way to the late 1570s. That's an entire generation we had to rely on ourselves for everything. Everything from governance to security, many of our lands went back and forth even though both claimed to be in total control of transylvania. This has basically laid the foundation for an independent transylvania. Where we saw ourselves as Magyars and Hungarians before we have effectively torn ourselves off culturally and traditionally. Where the western Hungarians directed ever westward we entrenched ourselves in our Magyar and Roman ancestry in Transylvania creating a cultural east-west split for Hungarians."

After the habsburg inheritance of hungary in 1526 was deemed illegal and a usurper too much of east hungary to them the royal line continued via the Zápolya family. So Hungary effectively came to be in a succession war on the one side the von Habsburg imperium and on the other a distant uncle of the former king of Hungary. However Zápolya realized that he couldn't win this war alone and allied himself with the ottomans. He established the eastern Hungarian kingdom. After the death of John Zaploya however the realm was disbanded and the principality of Transylvania was born under his son elected Prince of Transylvania John II. in the treaty of Speyer in which both the habsburg and the ottoman crown acknowledged its independence and autonomy. John II would in compensation forgo his claim on the kingdom of Hungary under the guarantee that transylvania wouldn't be part of Hungary propper anymore but a principality under the hungarian crown. This meant that the king of Hungary couldn't lay direct claim to the principality but dejure they were princes of Hungary."

This caused a big immigration of those infected by the ideas of the reformation, mainly Lutherans and reformed variety. Although they did not initial find homes in pre-existing communities and had to set up some of their own. The reformation would reach the princely court in 1563 with the arrival of Giorgio Blandrata who was a Unitarian. But the true influence of the reformation wouldn't arrive in Transylvania until Ferenc Dávid. He would take his first steps as a theologian for the catholic faith after he finished his education in germany. After which he would convert to Lutheranism and then again to reformed. He would gain notoriety in the principality and would gain an audience with the prince. Here after long discussions the prince would convince him that the anti-trinitarian or the unitarian church in fact was the correct one and they both John II and Ferenc Dávid converted then and there to the unitarian church. After this Ferenc Dávid would debate the Reformed humanist Péter Melius Juhász for the dominant faith in transylvania. Péter was arguing for the adoption of the calvinist reformed faith and the since converted Ferenc argued for the belief of religious freedom. To abolish the idea of state religion or favoritism towards a religion all together as long as that religion was christianity ofcourse. These debates led to Ferenc's ideas proving more popular and thus the Edict of Torda was established. The edict states that every city township and community was allowed to vote for themselves which religion it would follow. These elections would happen again every time the spiritual leader of the community would die. It would also legally protect and guarantee the religious freedoms, rights and beliefs of those of the catholics, unitarians, lutherans and reformed. This however did not extend to those of the Orthodox church they were suggested to be tolerated but that wasn't legally binding. But it was still revolutionary for its time and making it the first legal edict of its kind in Europe and sparking the trend of religious freedom which would become dominant all over europe."

While the sipahi form their own distinctive social classes, and are often in rivalry with the Janissaries, their skills as cavalrymen make them a show of force on the battlefield. Utilising the Timar system, Timariots are granted a fief of land directly by the Ottoman sultan or with his official permission by beylerbeys. They are entitled to all of the income from that land, in return for military service. The peasants on the land are subsequently attached thereto, granting the Timariots similar status to contemporary knights. In wartime, Timarli sipahis and their retainers were gathered under their alay-beys. The equipment and tactics differ between the Anatolian and Balkan Timarli Sipahi. The Anatolian Sipahi were equipped and fought as classic horse archers, shooting while galloping, yet they weren't nomadic cavalry and their status was similar to medium cavalry class. Balkan Timarli Sipahis wore chainmail, rode barded horses and carried lances and javelins, and fought as medium cavalry."

Later on, during the conquest of the Balkans, the Turks, with the religious sanction of the grand mufti, took as tribute from the Christian population a percentage of the male children. These became the 'slaves of the sultan'. Completely severed from their Christian families, these children were brought up as Muslims and imbued with religious devotion to Islam and loyalty to the sultan. The more able were enrolled in the palace corps of pages and trained to become administrators and officials into the Sublime Porte.

After that a goodly tree sprang forth, which grew in beauty and in strength, ever greater and greater. Still did the embracing verdure of its boughs and branches cast an ampler and an ampler shade, until they canopied the extreme horizon of the three parts of the world. Under the tree stood four mountains, which he knew to be Caucasus, Atlas, Taurus, and Haemus. These mountains were the four columns that seemed to support the dome of the foliage of the sacred tree with which the earth was now centered. From the roots of the tree gushed forth four rivers, the Tigris, the Euphrates, the Danube, and the Nile. Tall ships and barks innumerable were on the waters. The fields were heavy with harvest. The mountain sides were clothed with forests. Thence in exulting and fertilizing abundance sprang fountains and rivulets that gurgled through thickets of the cypress and the rose. In the valleys glittered stately cities, with domes and cupolas, with pyramids and obelisks, with minarets and towers. The Crescent shone on their summits: from their galleries sounded the Muezzin's call to prayer. That sound was mingled with the sweet voices of a thousand nightingales, and with the prattling of countless parrots of every hue. Every kind of singing bird was there. The winged multitude warbled and flitted around beneath the fresh living roof of the interlacing branches of the all-overarching tree; and every leaf of that tree was in shape like unto a scimitar. Suddenly there arose a mighty wind, and turned the points of the sword-leaves towards the various cities of the world, but especially towards Constantinople. That city, placed at the junction of two seas and two continents, seemed like a diamond set between two sapphires and two emeralds, to form the most precious stone in a ring of universal empire.

Although many decisions were taken outside the formal context of the Imperial Council, it was the main executive body of the Empire, conducting all kinds of tasks of government such as the conduct of foreign relations, including the reception of foreign ambassadors, the preparation of campaigns, the construction of fortifications and public buildings, the reception of reports from the provincial governors and the appointments to state office, as well as continuing to function as a court of law, particularly for members of the military class."

Ottoman control of the Red Sea meanwhile began in 1517 when Selim I annexed Egypt to the Ottoman Empire after the Battle of Ridaniya. Most of the habitable zone of the Arabian Peninsula soon fell voluntarily to the Ottomans. Selim entered into negotiations with Sultan Muzaffar II of Gujarat, about a possible joint strike against the Portuguese in Goa, which would be officially ratified following a joint Mamlukean-Gujarat-Calicut naval coalition that the Sultan aided in, even though the Battle of Diu was a major loss. The naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean were only partially successful. The original goals of checking Portuguese domination in the ocean and assisting a Muslim Indian lord were, naturally enough, not achieved. On the other hand, Yemen, as well as the west bank of the Red Sea, roughly corresponding to a narrow coastal strip of Sudan and Eritrea, were annexed by Özdemir Pasha, the deputy of Hadim Suleiman Pasha. Three more provinces in East Africa were established in Massawa, Habesh and Sawakin. The ports around the Arabian Peninsula were also secured.

Their military strategies are very ill suited for urban combat in uneven and difficult terrain. On the other hand their submission tactics via the church and nobles were easily convinced of our plight for freedom, gaining the support of many of the German nobility who had been put in place to rule over us. Their expertise and know-how of their strategies and the inner working of the order would help us gain our freedom.

On the other hand the German influence would have way more to do with education. The German influence would revolutionize education. Opening up to all and no longer making it for the elite focusing on universal literacy and basic mathematics. They would also bring the idea with them of splitting the state and church which took ground rather quickly, immediately changing the political landscape of estonia. Lastly the Estonian language would be heavily promoted in church, producing the first bible in the vernacular and shifting away from Latin for masses. With all this however it's important to remember that the protestants and the reformed were the religions of the elite, the urban and the foreigners. The majority of Estonians were still either catholic or orthodox. These ideas would also be welcomed by them but to them it was important that the estonian churches remind the estonian churches.

Our nobility did not only import their heritage ideals and language however. The main two defining factors of our germanisition would be in our architecture and our education. The adoption of grand gothic architecture combined with baltic simplicity gave our skyline an extremely unique look. On the other hand, German free thinkin education provided our ppl with education for everyone and turned us into a modern state."

 hie_liv_born_in_the_fires_of_war_desc: "The region we call Livonia and Estonia was once ruled by pagans. In the name of our lord we were commanded to bring the word to these pagans. Initially they resisted so we forced them to see the truth. This caused both us and the local pagan tribes to be baptized by the fires of war. The fighting was not only extremely heavy and constant and on both sides many died in the defense of their ideals. Our order was born out of war and the pagans we conquered and showed the true way were hardened by it. We have created a society ruled by a military order that rules over a people who have been hardened by war. Unlike the teutonic order we don't put silly restrictions on recruitment like they have to be German. This gave us not only an extremely militarily structured society but a great pool of battled hardened recruits."

 hie_liv_livonian_brothers_of_the_sword_desc: "After the livonian crusades the bishop of Riga petitioned the pope for serenity over these newly acquired lands. That plan however backfired and the pope saw it fit to promote a few humble knights, veterans of the livonian campaign to our founding brothers. Our founding brothers then founded the order of the livonian brothers of the sword. We were mandated to protect the priests converting the local pagans and maintain the peace and safety of the land. We did not only make the priests able to do their job but at the same time make the territory of the order be one of the safest places in all of europe. We made the roads safe to travel and anyone could walk alone on the street day and night."

The knights' templar were a great aide in establishing our order at the great displeasure of the teutonic order. We chose the knights templar as our parent order because we did not only admire their achievements and prowess. Just like us they traveled to far unconquered lands and where only made lights like us after their deeds in the crusades. Not only that but their codex is also one of the most strict in the aspect of military training. While at the same time being quite progressive for its time regarding their treatment of heretics and heathens.

We argued to the pope that no other order was under the authority of any one else but the pope. However the papacy disagreed with us and made it clear that we were subject to the authority of the bishop. Well we disagreed and we started to ignore the bishop and his commands, we would no longer function as the bishops personal fighting force. Henceforth we would function on our own, we would rule ourselves and make our own decisions no longer shall we obey a little man with a tall hat in Riga."

In fact it shook our order to the core only leaving just shy of a 100 knights alive. Everyone else had fallen including our grandmaster and all our chapter masters. In fact we didn't even have enough brothers left to fully man our main chapter castle. So in our of time of need the papacy opened a door for us and started the conversation for unification with the teutonic order. We would become a chapter of their order and maintain a certain degree of authority. We would adhere to their codex and recognize the authority of their grandmaster. In return we would retain our orders autonomy in the form of a semi independent successor chapter as the livonian order. We would both retain our land and our authority over it."

After this we sought closer relationships with poland. And due to constant conflict with the bishop in Riga we go rather disillusioned with the catholic church. Making it so that our last chapter master Gothard kettler secularized the state and converted to lutheranism ending the livonian order and reconfiguration of our realm into a duchy."

Together with the Lithuanians in the south and the Estonians to our north we are the original tribes of the baltics. The Estonians had their ships and the Lithuanians had their horses adapting to the boons of their lands. As for us, the marshy wet swam land crossed through by big rivers would force us into a highly mobile and devastating form of warfare. Abusing not only the land but also our skill off it against our enemies. Our fast and light infantry moving through the swamp lands like a breeze through a forest, never really seen nor heard until it was too late.

The practice consists of flattening the top of the hill and fortifying the entire newly-created plateau on top. These defenses consisted of sets of ditches, obstacles, a wall at the crest of the hill with usually a town or a military complex on the inside."

 hie_ltg_latgalian_construction_desc: "The land has dictated our way of life here. It has not made it easy for our people to live in cities or concentrated urban centers unless there was a big hill in the neighborhood. This forced us to come up with creative forms of town and or city building. In clear spaces usually around a lake a form of raft building was most common. What it was, in effect, were sets of very thick wooden platforms that were built directly onto the ground if you could even call it that. On which houses would be built these platforms would be interconnected by non fixed bridges. This would make sure in case of a particularly wet period the homes would remain dry and that connections between platforms wouldn't break due to differences in elevation or original positions. In the more densely forested areas stilt constructions were favored using the treas itself as the main support beams for the houses who usually stood well above the floodlines of the marches and rivers."

Rather we have divided the land among bishops who have clans of nobles who support and sponsor those bishops. The thought was worldly greed and was the fundamental reason of internal conflict between aristocracy. So in the livonian system the kingdom was divided into four major bishoprics Riga, Dorpat, Ösel-Wiek and courtland. Of Course their influence only extended up to a certain point and that's where the aristocracy came in. To prevent abuse of the system was set up so that candidates for bishops had to run for office.

This not only opens up to a lot of luxury resources and markets. While at the same time drawing a lot of trade our way.

A permanent diet was formed for the estates and later on also a people's parliament.

This nickname and notoriety has not only aided us in trade being the center of organic goods for the baltic. Trading primarily things like grain flax berries pelts and alcohol.

Not only opening the continental eastern europe to loads of new goods but going as far as scandinavia. All of a sudden traders went from handling wheat and flax to trading in silks gold, gemstones and spices never seen before.

But the citizens disagreed, and with revolts raging and pressure coming from the papacy, the city of riga and the bishopric of riga would split. The city would still be subordinate to the bishop but in regards to ruling the city the bishop would henceforth need to keep himself to a constitution written by the citizens of riga. The bishop also didn't have supreme authority he would be head of state but the actual ruling and day to day functions would be given to the newly formed city council of riga. The leadership of the victorious citizens would proclaim the split of state and church to great displeasure of albert.

With it receiving drafts upon drafts of immigrants fleeing the Holy Roman Empire. They would  bring  their ideals of the reformation with them creating a safe haven for protestants and reformed alike. This would make riga one of the first great centers of the reformation and they would export this influence as far and wide as they could.

After his death, however, the brother would be tapped to be king, not the son due to his young age. His succession seemed guaranteed until the king, his uncle, managed to have a son at an ancient age. With his nephew being the direct heir Sukaphaa was seen as nothing but a threat to the current line out of fear for his life he would flee from Mong Mao with a group of loyalist ministers, soldiers, and guards who believed him to be the rightful king. Along his journey west he would gather a group of his people who also supported his claim and joined Sukaphaa on his journey west. He would eventually arrive in the isolated disjointed and extremely primitive valley of Brahmaputra. With the indigenous people lacking an economic government and any form of written word, he would introduce the native people of the valley to exactly that. A coin-based economy construction with long-lasting materials such as stone, his arrival would also see the first introduction of a feudal and kingship system to stabilise the disjointed tribal hierarchy.

Our people are used to living in tropical climates given our ancestral homeland. The tai would thrive in the kingdom of Ahom while never making up any form of majority, the ethnic tai of Mahon would always be seen as rather superior in being by the local Vedic population due to their legacy as fire bringers.

While the army of itself was in the beginning not much to look at, it has evolved since then. Since the founding of our kingdom, we have survived three Burmese invasions led by the Ava Confederacy. Resisted five more Bengal invasions. We have become known for the fact our troops stand and fight; they might not be the most skilled, the most elite or the most impressive. We will however never run away for a fight, we will stand and face our enemy no matter the cost. This self-instilled discipline has become the pride of our people, regardless we stand and fight. The one thing we would excel in starting from the 16th century with the introduction of gunpowder weaponry would be the use of cannons. While not all field guns we would use the cannon as a deadly force in its stationary capacity.

Over the past 200 years since the foundation of our kingdom, the purity of the Tai heritage has been somewhat watered down. For this very reason, there was a genuine effort being made to meld the cultures of the Tai-Ahom and the local Vedic people. This hybridization between Vedic and Tai started with the introduction of the Sanskrit script, replacing the hard-to-enforce Tai script since the Vedic language isn't compatible with its alphabet. In higher court culture the Tai would find dominance making the nobility farmers and patricians more predominantly Tai in cultural practices while the clergy artisan and traders would maintain a predominant Vedic cultural heritage. However, the bridge was gapped and the establishment of Assamese culture would find its place in the subcontinent. Known for its courtly focus especially with the introduction of the extensive Tai ceremonies and courtly structure while the further down you go the more Vedic it gets with all religious ceremonies and cultural holidays being near exclusively Vedic in origin.

Taking great inspiration from the very advanced Bengali ships incorporating their designs into our riverships creating a harmony of river and ocean ship. Used predominantly as an artillery platform in the river and a fast strike force on the ocean. Mounted with Assamese gunners these ships would pack both an incredible punch and be extremely precise. Due to the many rivers in the Bengal Delta deep enough to sail, they would modify their battles around them making sure they would always be within reach of one of their ships using it as a mobile fort and artillery platform. While at sea they would sweep in and out delivering a set of extremely precise and effective barrages disengaging reloading and they would repeat.

In effect, it is more than that though the Palik system is a military structural and bureaucratic system. The two main offices within the government are the Bureau of Taxation and the Bureau of the Military. The Bureau of Taxation concerns itself with anything and all taxable in other words any form of labour goods and trade. While the military bureau is concerned it also deals with goods but only those relevant to the army and its functionality and payment equipping and maintaining both the small standing military force and the levies. Any form of military service would be compensated for example in the case of levies each week served would translate into a month exempted from taxes after service has ended.

Cowries doubtless were used in the majority of transactions involving physical money. They were the money of choice for revenue payments from the small holdings, ferry tolls, etc. They were the money of daily market exchanges, foodstuffs, basic apparel and the like. Where the labour market was monetised, cowries provided salaries for labourers. They were the 'money of the people' for their time and place."

 hie_bng_integrated_war_elephants_desc: "While the use of elephants in war was nothing new in the subcontinent, the Bengali Sultans took advantage of the abundance of elephants in the Delta region and were wise enough to see their full utility, taking the use of elephants to the next level. Not only were elephants suited to the jungle territory cut by many rivers of the area, but with proper training they could be used for everything from shock forces and logistics to even assisting with shipbuilding. In addition, elephants from Indochina were imported to supplement the native population, and tribute or spoils from neighbouring states was often demanded in the form of elephants, with a notable example being that of the founder of the Sultanate, Ilyas Shah, who returned from a successful campaign against Orissa with 44 elephants as spoils."

 hie_bng_delta_city_planning_desc: "One of the most major differences between the Bengali Sultanate and prior states that ruled the Bengal Delta was the involvement of the Sultans in city planning and construction. Under their rule, cities would see straight roads, planned districts, well-arranged commercial and residential areas, and imposing city walls. This would encourage even further trade and economic output, and garner the attention of people from all over Asia. Ming envoys recorded the major trade cities of Bengal with awe and admiration, and sang their praises as the richest and best places in the world to trade in, as they were filled with every kind of goods."

The noble intention of preaching Islam was the main factor which drove them to leave their hearth and home for Bengal. They came to Bengal, often alone, and preached Islam in the secluded areas throughout their lives under unfavourable circumstances. While the social and religious condition of the people was caste divided, the Sufis came here carrying with them the egalitarian message of Islam. Because of their strong belief in Allah, and theoretical and practical teachings of universal brotherhood, Sufis could easily satisfy the spiritual cravings of the masses. The activities of the Sufis and their inherent qualities made them familiar to the masses, who were already groaning under social tyranny and suffering from the agony of spiritual yearnings of the soul."
 hie_bng_consolditaion_of_zamindars_and_taluqdars: "Consolidation of Zamindars and Taluqdars"
 hie_bng_consolditaion_of_zamindars_and_taluqdars_desc: "In the early days of the Sultanate, most of the land was a patchwork of estates divided between many local landowners. These came in two broad categories. While originally a Persian term for landowner, Zamindars came to refer to the local, mostly Hindu, small landowners. On the other hand, the Delhi Sultanate granted large tracts of land to newly-arrived Muslim nobles, who became the Taluqdars. These nobles owned much more land than the Zamindars, but were far fewer in number. It was perhaps inevitable that tensions rose, often fueled by ethnic and religious lines. Occasionally there were landowners, especially Hindu ones, who would even challenge the Sultan’s authority itself. The Sultan’s solution is simple; consolidate as many of the lands under a few large and loyal families, both Hindu and Muslim, as possible to remove petty border disputes.This can be done by land grants to certain powerful families who have proven their loyalty, or the reassignment of smaller landholders as vassals of larger ones. This does have the side effect of massively empowering the nobility as a whole at the expense of the peasant castes, but the gains to the state justify ignoring the peasant rabble."

This increased awareness of the Sultan abroad, but also served to connect Bengal to a steady supply of new Islamic scholars from all over the Muslim world to and from Bengal, creating a more vibrant Muslim population in the region. It was this influence, combined with the building of new mosques and the publishing of Islamic works in vernacular Bengali language, that lead to a large portion of the Hindu population willingly embracing Islam, a unique occurrence in the history of the subcontinent."

Its minor rights, which were unlike every other company, was that they both had the right to establish their own navies and armies. Focusing on its main two tasks the British government would fully subsidise a colonial and a merchant office for the full duration of the companies existence.

In contrast to a plantation that usually consisted of a main house surrounded by farmlands where they produced raw materials like sugar cane for example. While a factory is more a reinforced structure often within a fort where raw materials would arrive and refined goods would be produced specifically for export back to the country of origin. In India the first of their kind were silk factories employing the local population of skilled hands to mass produce a product for consumption back in europe. These factories were extremely lucrative and profitable making their owners rich beyond once dreams. At their peak the East India company would count over a 1000 of these factories on the Indian subcontinent alone."

Finding employment at the east india company as admirals traders to even making part of the leadership of the company if they had the money to buy in to the board. The reliance of these adventurers of various ways of life hungry to prove themselves and even hungrier for riches and power would form the foundation of our naval leadership.

While the construction of large navies isn't quite in our budget we could rely on the large number of light ships provided by these independent adventurers joining our ranks and arm our trade ships themselves. The policy of militarising our own trade ships meant expanding them so they could carry the same cargo while adding additional space for canons.

 hie_eic_presidency_system: "Presidency System"
 hie_eic_presidency_system_desc: "The presidency system, established by the British East India Company during its dominance in India from the 17th to 19th centuries, comprised three major administrative units: Bengal, Madras, and Bombay Presidencies. Each was presided over by a designated president, with Bengal encompassing present-day Bangladesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and parts of Assam; Madras covering southern India, including Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, and parts of Odisha; and Bombay including regions of western India such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, and parts of Karnataka. These presidencies operated with their own administrative and judicial systems, allowing for regional autonomy while maintaining the authority of the East India Company and later the British Crown. The presidents, typically British officials, directed matters of taxation, justice, trade, and diplomacy, supported by councils composed of Company officials. The term presidential armies are the military forces maintained by the Company in each presidency, which played a crucial role in expanding and maintaining British control over Indian territories. These armies mainly consisted of Indian Sepoy conscripts with a British officer core which an Indian could not achieve supported by British cavalry brigades and artillery divisions. While not a particularly effective of noterray fighting force what they did not lack in was manpower either force conscription or conscription by the allure of escaping poverty the numbers of the presidential armies would neve lack in bodies to fill the gap."

It in effect allows a senior officer of the east india company being housed in a foreign state to work as a direct diplomat or a representative of the board. This direct communication is handy to maintain diplomatic relations and avoid misunderstandings but it was also a form of control, warning the state in question to not go against the wishes of the board or there would be consequences. Not wanting to lose both the protection and the economic boons that came along with having the company as an ally. On the other hand you have the established princely states. The princely states are established protectorates and some even have vassal-like relationships with the company. It's a practice where in favour of overthrowing a well established regime, they would rather puppet the state in the favour of continued legit government to prevent rebellions and maintain ancient production practices on which a lot of these company factories rely on."

In effect having a near global control of the movement of goods from Asia to Europe on the new world would remain the largest open market in the world. The control of this market would only fail with the war of American independence and the subsequent indepence of the United States. Up to that point, however, the E.I.C. Would control 69% of global naval trade and goods production regarding refined products and the trade of those products. Achieving and maintaining this global monopoly should be the final and only goal of the company."

Long ago, when the world was young and the gods walked among mortals, our people emerged from the depths of the earth, born of the union between the sky and the earth. We are a proud and fierce tribe, warriors skilled in the arts of battle and hunting, yet wise in the ways of nature and the spirits that dwelled within it. Legend tells of our ancestral homeland, a mythical kingdom hidden amidst the mist-shrouded hills, where we ruled with honour and courage. Our ancestors worshipped the spirits of the land, offering prayers and sacrifices to appease the ancient guardians who watched over our tribe. As the ages passed, shadows began to stir in the depths of the forest, and whispers of danger echoed through the valleys. Dark forces, envious of our prosperity and strength, sought to engulf their kingdom in darkness and chaos. Through fierce and harrowing trials, the Dimasa fought with unmatched valour, their spirits unyielding in the face of adversity. They drew strength from the ancient bonds that bound them to the land, tapping into the wisdom of our ancestors to guide their every step.

From common words all the way to basically understanding one another just with weird forms of speech, like in the case of the Burmese and the Tibetans. This linguistic commonality with such a large part of Asia comes at a significant advantage. Having any form of commonality, especially regarding the Chinese is a huge diplomatic advantage let alone a great economic one since trust is immediately established.

Our hands sculpted the first palaces and temples, monuments that defied the ages and stood as testaments to our ingenuity. With each chisel stroke and carefully placed stone, we wove tales of architectural marvels that captured the imagination of all who beheld them. Our mastery over stone was not merely a skill; it was a legacy that echoed through the annals of time.

The adoption of the Sanskrit alphabet was not merely a matter of convenience; it was crucial for our survival. As we embraced Sanskritization, we found ourselves drawn towards the Hindu faith, forsaking our traditional local beliefs.

Membership in this clan was exclusive and hereditary, with only those born into its lineage deemed eligible. Even individuals presenting purported evidence of lineage were unable to gain entry, as belonging to the Royal Clan was believed to be ordained since time immemorial. This esteemed clan symbolised the embodiment of tradition, power, and ancestry, serving as custodians of our collective heritage. Next in prominence was the Clan of the Sons of the Hills, encompassing a diverse array of artisans, political dynasties, merchants, smiths, farmers, artists, and masons. This clan formed the backbone of our society, contributing to its economic prosperity, cultural richness, and political stability. Within its ranks resided the craftsmen who crafted marvels from stone, the traders who traversed distant lands in search of goods, and the farmers who toiled the earth to sustain our livelihoods. It was a clan characterised by its versatility, resilience, and entrepreneurial spirit, embodying the essence of community and cooperation. Completing the triad was the Warrior Clan, composed of military dynasties, traditional warrior families, and foreign mercenaries. This clan stood as the guardians of our realm, sworn to protect our borders, uphold justice, and defend our way of life.

Leveraging our intimate knowledge of the terrain and environment, exploiting the cover of darkness, the dense foliage of the jungle, and the strategic advantage of the hills to confound and outmanoeuvre our foes, our approach was characterised by hit-and-run tactics, meticulously planned ambushes, and guerrilla warfare techniques. Under the cloak of night, our troops moved swiftly and silently, employing the natural features of the landscape to conceal their movements and strike with precision. By utilising the element of surprise and capitalising on our adversaries' vulnerabilities, we sought to disrupt their cohesion, sow confusion, and inflict maximum damage while minimising our own losses. Central to our strategy was the judicious deployment of our forces and the exploitation of strategic chokepoints and defensible positions. We would harass and hunt our enemies relentlessly, wearing down their morale and resources through a relentless campaign of attrition. Meanwhile, we would strategically position our reserves, waiting patiently for the opportune moment to unleash a decisive blow or exploit a weakness in their defences. In addition, we employed a shrewd use of auxiliary forces, including slaves, to bolster our ranks and support our main army.

The constitution protects all those under its laws for those who are of Meitei descent. One proven parent is enough to qualify. This protection exempts you from certain forms of taxation and allows trade to happen without interdiction. It also protected the right of religious freedom among its people.

The younger brother of Aurangzeb, Shah Shuja would seek shelter here for his brother banished him for his mild treatment of non-believers. Arriving with some 2000 like-minded muslims they would settle here out of reach of the empire and their persecution bringing with them a vast treasure trove of knowledge and modern gunpowder weapons which were a vast upgrade over our Chinese matchlocks. While they would always maintain themselves to be a small minority and didn't try to convert our people, our people thus learned to accept them. They were given their own neighbourhoods, schools and religious rights but they weren't allowed to spread their faith. One of the last major influxes in muslims in the region came when the brother of the sultan of Bengal in the late 17th century made an attempt to expand the sultanate of bengal. Who tried to invade the region with about 1500 meant to make us subjugate tho their god and to the sultan. The majority of his men and the sultan's brother were killed.

Hit or miss these weapons would be very effective; the sound of them screaming across the sky and the battlefield would terrify man and animal alike. If they then did hit their target or any target for that matter would have a devastating effect, having a strong enough explosive force to damage wooden constructions like palisades and even western ships.

Militarism penetrated into all ranks of the society and all able-bodied persons were called upon to perform military service. The king had a standing army, but the number of the local militia was far greater than the number of the soldiers in the standing army. Besides, the feudal lords also supplied to the king a stipulated number of soldiers at the time of war and had to fight for him in the battle field, thus it can be said the Odishan organisation was very well streamlined for its time. The first division was known as the Hantakaru Daa Le, the pioneer force clearing jungles and making roads; the second was known as the Aguani Thata i.e., the advance units; the third was Pradhana Vala i.e., the main army and the fourth division was Pachhiani Thata i.e., the rear guards.

They were the money of choice for revenue payments from the small holdings, ferry tolls, etc. They were the money of daily market exchanges, foodstuffs, basic apparel and the like. Where the labour market was monetised, cowries provided salaries for labourers. They were the 'money of the people' for their time and place."

 hie_mbl_usurp_the_sultanates_desc: "Originally, Muslim presence in the Bengali region was peaceful. When the Delhi nation attacked, however, everything changed. For generations afterwards, our lands were subjected to repeated invasion by Muslim warlords which often defeated our armies and left us subjugated. While this story repeated itself throughout India, an unusual form of resistance we employed was the infiltration of the Sultanates by Hindu loyalists, sometimes even crypto-Hindus passing themselves off as Muslims. Several times, crypto-Hindus were even able to ascend to the throne of the sultans, prompting a relief of the oppression by the Muslims and a revival of Bengali cultural supremacy in its homeland. May Vishnu never let us forget the lessons of this hardship. "
 hie_mbl_confederation_of_zamindars: "Confederation of Zamindars"
 hie_mbl_confederation_of_zamindars_desc: "Zamindars was a Persianate word used by the invading Muslims to segregate and thereby subjugate the Hindu landowners in the lands they conquered. Eventually, the term was adopted by even non-Muslim princes to refer to the nobility of Bengal. When faced with foreign invasion, they banded together to defend river crossings and field large armies to repulse the invaders, holding even the likes of the Mughals at bay."
 hie_mbl_jamdani_production: "Jamdani Production"
 hie_mbl_jamdani_production_desc: "Jamdani, known to the Arabic and Western worlds as muslin, and to the British as calico, has been woven in Bengal since ancient times. The combination of the local soft Delta cotton with a high degree of skill and craftsmanship has made this fine and soft yet durable cloth famous the world over, second only to silk in its ability to inspire frenzied buying and admiration. While there are many imitators, merely the mention that fine muslin is imported from Bengal catches profits from Copenhagen to Kyoto, sparking a sort of industrial golden age of our own here in the subcontinent, with our economic output matching or surpassing most European states."

 hie_ngp_bengali_calendar: "Bengali Calendar"
 hie_ngp_bengali_calendar_desc: "Dating from (and starting in) the western year 594 A.D., this solar-year calendar is arguably the pinnacle of the long tradition of Hindu mathematical and time-keeping development. By tracking the movements of Surya (the sun) and the moon, the Bengali king Shashanka was able to develop a highly accurate calendar that would go without revision for over a millennium. This not only made the timing of religious festivals more accurate, but proved a boon for agriculture as well. "
 hie_ngp_paiks: "Paiks"
 hie_ngp_paiks_desc: "While various formations and organisations of infantry are used around the world, the unique manner of the Bengali Delta region proved very effective, especially in its native environment of dense jungles, riverine crossings, and other difficult terrain. The Paiks were originally a caste of labourers who paid their taxes in labour. This labour eventually specialised in military service and the production of arrows for the state. Paik infantry units were a loose combination of archers and infantry that somewhat resembled the style later developed by Maurice of Nassau in Europe. This made them highly manoeuvrable and effective, catching the notice of such military masterminds as Babur Timurid, who incorporated their style into the army of the Mughal Empire"
 hie_ngp_religious_pluralism: "Religious Pluralism"
 hie_ngp_religious_pluralism_desc: "The Delta has long been a convergence point for widely different religious beliefs. From the long-standing Dharmic traditions to the ancient Pala empire which popularised Mahayana Buddhism to the region, to the neighbouring Vajrayana Buddhists of the Himalayas and the later Sultanates being the furthest outposts of Islam in the easts, our land has been home to many faiths, one never quite managing to get the upper hand. Later on, even Christianity would begin to spread in the region. This intransigent diversity has necessitated policies of religious pluralism from all realms to rise and fall in the region. "
 hie_ngp_coin_and_cowry: "Coin and Cowry"
 hie_ngp_coin_and_cowry_desc: "The tanka was used extensively in the formal economy for purposes of revenue collection but as also for the expenditures of royalty, nobility, government, military and religious establishments. Its volume expanded with its broader usage, gradually edging out the cowry for macro economic functions and relegating that denomination to micro economic status. The normative money was the Tanka, a relatively heavy pure silver coin, supplemented by a 'small change' of cowry shells. Cowries doubtless were used in the majority of transactions involving physical money. They were the money of choice for revenue payments from the small holdings, ferry tolls, etc. They were the money of daily market exchanges, foodstuffs, basic apparel and the like.

 hie_eng_common_law: "Common Law"
 hie_eng_common_law_desc: "A vestige of England's Saxon roots, the common law, unlike Roman law traditions on the mainland, is a collection of traditions and decisions overtime, much of them embodied in general principles rather than written down. While often inflexible and cumbersome, it has proved a durable and effective institution for keeping England remarkably stable over the centuries."
 hie_eng_royal_navy: "The Royal Navy"
 hie_eng_royal_navy_desc: "England's geographic position on the preeminent island of Europe has many challenges that only naval innovations could solve. From the first navy commissioned by Alfred the Great to ward off Viking incursions, to the Elizabethan reforms manning the Channel, the only protection England had from stronger continental powers, England's identity has owed itself in large part to protection by sea. The Royal Navy was thus the largest and proudest of Europe's many powerful navies for centuries."
 hie_eng_acts_union: "Acts of Union"
 hie_eng_acts_union_desc: "The English, and later British, national identity were forged by the linking of various nations, cultures, languages, and traditions together. The English language alone is a remarkable amalgamation of Latin, Frankish, Norse, and Germanic influences. The history of England from Alfred the Great's union of the Anglo-Saxon realms into a common Angleland, down through the attempted union with France and the eventual union with Scotland followed this trend. Finally, this tradition culminated in the Acts of Union. Starting with the abolishment of centuries of laws reflecting hostility between two nations, it then rebranded the kingdom title to better suit the nations' new identity, resolved trade disputes, granted special status to local customs, and guaranteed the freedom of the local state church. In all, it followed the English custom of creating a mutually beneficial union, making the process much smoother than for most attempts at unification."
 hie_eng_acts_concerning_regulation_trade: "Acts Concerning the Regulation of Trade"
 hie_eng_acts_concerning_regulation_trade_desc: "From the Navigation Acts to the later Stamp Acts, the heavy involvement of the institution of Parliament in trade, due in large part to the self-interests of its members, meant the trade laws were codified in great detail in England before in most other countries, allowing them to become one of the most dominant trading powers in world history."
 hie_eng_new_model_army: "New Model Army"
 hie_eng_new_model_army_desc: "After the Hundred Years' War and the defeat of and union with Scotland, England for decades allowed its army to decay, as its navy protected it from any serious threat. As modern weaponry advanced, however, England was forced to play catch up as it remained on a largely medieval model in an early modern context. To this end, prominent military leaders successfully advocated for comprehensive army reform, establishing a uniform, professional, and disciplined elite which was the envy of Europe at the time, around which a more modernized army in general could be built."
 hie_eng_admiralty: "The Admiralty"
 hie_eng_admiralty_desc: "The unusually vital importance of naval power to England's success meant that England spent far more of it's state revenues on navy than other states and the army and navy often competed for available resources and manpower. To solve this, the English Crown created the Secretary of the Admiralty, which devoted a fixed set of resources and taxes to maintaining a professional modern navy at a time when many nations still relied on drafted merchant ships and privateers."
 hie_eng_empiricism: "Empiricism"
 hie_eng_empiricism_desc: "Referring to a larger trend in education, the royal court, and other elites that took root in England, Empiricism largely rejects the use of abstract philosophy and thought to uncover truth. Instead, it holds that the only way to learn truth is to observe, notate, and test the world as we and observe it through our senses. This philosophy, if it could be called such, provided a cradle for some of the best scientific minds in Europe, from Francis Bacon to Newton and beyond."

These articles would be tightened throughout the 18th century if a navy is defeated, and contributed to the dominance of the Royal Navy. Meanwhile the army saw increased professionalisation."
 hie_gbr_trade_and_navigation: "The Navigation Acts"
 hie_gbr_trade_and_navigation_desc: "The laws developed, promoted, and regulated English ships, shipping, trade, and commerce between other countries and with its own colonies. The laws also regulated England's fisheries and restricted foreigners' participation in its colonial trade. The laws suffered some setbacks from the Dutch and Spanish hegemony, but they were amended and Britain began to seal itself off from foreign imports. They embodied British mercantilism, and would remain in effect until the 19th century."
 hie_gbr_triangle_trade: "The Triangle Trade"
 hie_gbr_triangle_trade_desc: "The Atlantic Slave Trade eventually grew into the Triangle Trade as a way of dealing with trade imbalances. It also meant that large portions of 'settlers' in the new world were slaves, boosting the economic impact of the colonies. It also allowed Britain to increase its economic dominance in West Africa, in which many locals had become dependant on the Europeans for guns."

Innovations in shipbuilding and designing are often key to success, seen throughout history from Greek Fire to the Turtle Ship. Britain, with all its might on the seas, must emulate this and outfit the Royal Navy with the greatest ships seen to man."
 hie_gbr_redcoats: "Redcoats!"
 hie_gbr_redcoats_desc: "From the mid-17th century, the uniform of most British soldiers included a madder red coat or coatee. Redcoats, as they came to be known, are distinct in all corners of the empire, despite it's colloquial use, and the enemy knows when the empire has arrived. They know of the professional and highly trained troops that fight for King and Country."

We have finally triumphed by uniting the kings of Ireland under one higher crown.

In fact, knowledge of a land to the west is even part of our ancient past, surviving as the legend of the golden island of Ily Brasil. The search for this semi-mythical land inspires our sailors to great treks."

 hie_ire_introduction_potatoes: "Introduction of Potatoes"
 hie_ire_introduction_potatoes_desc: "Although originally from the Andes, the potato found an ideal habitat in Ireland, where the fertile damp soil sparked an explosion in abundance of the crop, and is far more nutritious than the barley and oats which we depended on before. By incorporating this crop into our farming (though not depending solely on it!), we can spark a golden age of growth and plenty for our people."

Our strategy was simple yet ambitious, we aimed to become the most active and prolific traders on the rivers of Yucatan. Our goal was clear, to outshine and outcompete all rivals, establishing unrivalled economic supremacy over the waterways coursing through the heart of Yucatan itself. Through tireless effort and relentless determination, we sought to cement our position as the undisputed masters of river commerce, wielding our influence to shape the flow of goods and wealth throughout the region. Driven by the desire for prosperity and power, we navigated the currents of trade with skill and savvy, seizing every opportunity to expand our reach and solidify our dominance.

However, with the collapse of Maya society and the constant warfare plaguing the region, it seemed as though the wealth we once enjoyed was slipping through our fingers. In response to this changing landscape, we turned our attention to the coastal seas, eager to explore untapped markets and forge new trade connections. Island by island, we charted a course along the coast, establishing trading posts and conducting commerce with distant shores. The rise of the Mexica tribes to the west presented a particularly enticing opportunity, as their newfound wealth offered the promise of lucrative trade partnerships. To navigate these unfamiliar waters, we relied on the expertise and connections of our Maya brethren of the Huastec, who served as invaluable intermediaries in our dealings with the Mexica.

This ambitious endeavour began with the establishment of trade outposts, strategically positioned to capitalise on lucrative trade opportunities beyond our borders. These outposts served as the seeds of true colonies, where settlers were encouraged to migrate and establish permanent settlements. The colonies served a singular purpose, to generate wealth for the kingdom by acting as centres of trade in markets previously inaccessible to us. In exchange for the privilege of conducting business within their walls, the colonies paid heavy tribute on all goods traded within their confines. This tribute served as a steady stream of revenue, flowing back into the coffers of the kingdom and fueling our continued expansion and prosperity. As the colonies flourished and our influence spread, we solidified our position as masters of commerce and trade in the region, leveraging our economic power to further consolidate our dominance over the land and sea.

In response, we were compelled to take unprecedented action, raising a navy in a manner previously unheard of in Maya society. The concept of a military navy, with ships and crews specifically trained for combat, was a radical departure from tradition. Yet, faced with the threat of piracy, we had no choice but to adapt and innovate. Our solution came in the form of the war canoe, a vessel unlike any seen before in Maya waters. These war canoes for the rivers were manned by up to ten warriors, armed with spears, swords, bows, and other ranged weapons. Designed to repel bandits and pirates, these canoes were slightly wider and longer than traditional vessels, allowing the crew to stand while sailing and providing ample storage for their weapons. Our efforts to combat piracy did not end there. On our larger coastal trade ships, we deployed warriors trained in both maritime trade and combat.

Yet, our enthusiasm for this trade waned when a mysterious illness swept through our traders and their families, leaving death in its wake. The spectre of disease loomed large, casting a shadow of fear and uncertainty over our interactions. Despite the risks, we cautiously continued to trade with the Europeans, albeit with greater trepidation. We recognized the value of their goods and the opportunities they presented, even as we grappled with the grim reality of the diseases they brought with them.

The people of Chactemal had mastered the art of agriculture in this challenging environment, harnessing the power of irrigation and ancient slash-and-burn techniques to cultivate the land. Their relationship with the earth was not merely practical; it was deeply spiritual. Every action, from the opening of the irrigation gates to the burning and slashing of the jungle in preparation for planting, was imbued with ritual and ceremony. These rituals were not just about ensuring a bountiful harvest but were seen as acts of reverence for the land and its divine connection. As the seasons turned and the cycles of life unfolded, the people of Chactemal celebrated their connection to the earth through these sacred rituals. The opening of the irrigation gates became a joyous ceremony, symbolising the giving of life-giving waters to the parched earth.

From these distant lands, where the earth is less fertile but the stones lie abundant, come traders bearing the precious cargo of alabaster and jade. These traders, hailing from lands where the soil is less yielding but the rocks are plentiful, exchange their valuable resources for the bounty of the jungle: the fruits of the earth, the harvests of the fields.

They honoured him with intricate rituals and ceremonies, weaving his presence into the fabric of their daily lives. In the fields, farmers toiled under the scorching sun, planting and tending to their crops with diligence and care. And when the time came for the harvest, they offered the first fruits of their labour to Kinich Ahau, thanking him for his benevolence and generosity. Kinich Ahau's influence extended beyond the fields; he was also revered as a symbol of kingship and divine authority. Maya kings claimed descent from the sun god, emphasising their divine mandate to govern and their role as stewards of the land. Throughout the Maya civilization, Kinich Ahau's image could be found adorning temple facades, stelae, and other religious monuments. His likeness, with its prominent hooked nose and circular headdress representing the sun, served as a reminder of his omnipresent gaze and his profound influence on Maya society. so, in the land of the Maya, the relationship between the people and Kinich Ahau was one of mutual respect and dependence.

They fostered a culture of innovation and creativity, inviting scholars and craftsmen from far and wide to contribute to the city's burgeoning legacy. As the years passed, Copan grew in strength and stature, its influence spreading across the Mayan lands. The K'atun Lords forged alliances, engaged in trade, and navigated the complex web of Mayan politics with skill and cunning. Like all great civilizations, the glory of Copan was not to last. In the twilight of its reign, the city faced challenges from within and without, until finally, its once-proud streets lay silent and abandoned. Yet, the legacy of the K'atun Lords lives on, etched into the stone of Copan's ruins and echoed in the whispers of its forgotten halls. Their story, though lost to the mists of time, serves as a reminder of the resilience and ingenuity of our people. Respecting those that shaped the culture and traditions of our people today."

Here, on the outer rim of the Mayan sphere, the Ch'orti' have carved out a thriving metropolis amidst the rugged and densely overgrown landscape. Life on the fringes of Mayan society is not without its challenges. The Ch'orti' find themselves surrounded by savage tribes, ignorant of the arts of agriculture, masonry, and literature. Instead of seeking to learn from their neighbours, these tribes resort to raiding and pillaging, preying upon the riches of Copan. In the face of these constant threats, the Ch'orti' are forced to take decisive action. They establish an honour guard, a dedicated force tasked with protecting their treasures and safeguarding their people. This honour guard becomes the backbone of a proto-professional army, trained in the arts of war and skilled in the defence of their homeland. Led by brave warriors and wise commanders, the honour guard stands as a bulwark against the tide of aggression, ready to defend Copan at all costs. They patrol the borders, watchful for any signs of danger, and stand ready to repel any invaders who dare to threaten their way of life."

Its vibrant green and iridescent blue plumage captivated the hearts of all who beheld it, and its long, trailing tail feathers were the stuff of legend. Among the Maya elite, particularly the rulers, priests, and nobility, quetzal feathers were treasured above all else. They were symbols of prestige, authority, and connection to the divine. To wear quetzal feathers was to be blessed by the gods themselves, and only the most esteemed members of society were deemed worthy of such adornment. In the great city-states of the Maya, rulers and nobles adorned themselves with elaborate headdresses, cloaks, and ceremonial garments made from quetzal feathers. These garments were worn during important rituals and ceremonies, from coronations and religious festivals to diplomatic events and royal processions. The acquisition of quetzal feathers was no simple task, for the birds were elusive and dwelled deep within the dense forests of Mesoamerica. Maya rulers and nobles employed various methods to obtain them, from receiving them as tribute from subordinate cities to engaging in trade networks with neighbouring regions. Despite their scarcity, quetzal feathers were more than just symbols of status; they were also valuable commodities in Maya society. Used as currency or traded for other goods and services, quetzal feathers played a vital role in the economic and social fabric of the Maya world. The gathering of quetzal feathers is the main labour of our people. We trade them and export them all over the Mayan sphere. While we arent the sole source of these feathers we do represent the highest concentrated percentage of the feather trade."

Central to our peoples faith is the principle of stewardship and sustainability. They understand that their actions have consequences for the natural world and strive to live in harmony with the land and its inhabitants. When harvesting plants or hunting animals, the Ch'orti' make a concerted effort to utilise every part of the organism, ensuring that nothing goes to waste. This practice reflects their deep respect for the gifts of the earth and their commitment to honouring the sacrifice of the plants and animals that sustain them. For our people, the act of taking a life, whether it be a plant or an animal, is accompanied by rituals and ceremonies that acknowledge the interconnectedness of all living things.

By venturing into these uncharted territories and sharing their knowledge of agriculture, masonry, literature, and pottery, our people can not only expand their influence but also enrich the lives of those living in the jungle. They envision a future where the southern lands are no longer seen as a barrier, but as a gateway to new opportunities and prosperity.

However, these achievements were marred by the intrusion of outside forces, such as the Aztecs, who sought to co-opt and distort the teachings of the Maya for their own purposes. Our people learned valuable lessons from these experiences, recognizing the dangers of cultural appropriation and the importance of preserving the integrity of their faith, society, and architecture. Rather than repeating the mistakes of the past, they now approach their expansion southwards with caution and foresight. As they venture into the untamed lands beyond their borders, our people remain steadfast in their commitment to spreading civilization and enlightenment.

It was a time of prosperity and power, as the Cocomes rulers wielded both secular and spiritual authority over their domain. From their grand palaces, they governed with wisdom and grace, presiding over elaborate ceremonies and rituals that honoured the gods and secured the prosperity of their people. Under our enlightened rule, Mayapan flourished as a centre of culture and commerce, its streets bustling with traders and artisans from far and wide. The city's architecture bore witness to its cosmopolitan nature, blending Maya and Toltec influences in a stunning display of creativity and craftsmanship. And yet, amidst the splendour of Mayapan, whispers of discontent began to stir. Power struggles among the ruling elite threatened to tear the city apart from within, as factions vied for control and influence. Despite the efforts of the Cocomes rulers to maintain order, the seeds of discord had been sown, and the city stood on the brink of chaos. Then, in the fateful year of 1441, disaster struck. Mayapan was besieged by enemies from without and torn apart by strife from within. The once-great city was sacked and razed to the ground, its magnificent temples and palaces reduced to ruins. As the smoke cleared and the dust settled, the Cocomes dynasty lay in ruins, its legacy all but forgotten amidst the rubble of Mayapan. Yet, even in defeat, our memory lived on, a testament to their vision.

The Maya paper, or amate, was a marvel of craftsmanship, created by shaving thin layers of bark and carefully smoothing them to create a durable and resilient writing surface. Unlike papyrus, which would decay in the humid climate of Mesoamerica, Maya paper withstood the test of time, preserving the words and images of generations past. These codices became the cornerstone of Maya religious and courtly society, serving as repositories of tradition, ritual, and wisdom. Within their pages, scribes meticulously recorded traditions and ceremonies that bound the Maya to their gods and ancestors, ensuring that these sacred traditions would endure for eternity. The codices were not just tools of religious devotion, they also served practical purposes in the administrative and bureaucratic affairs of Maya society. Courtly records, administrative documents, and genealogies were all meticulously recorded in the pages of these precious manuscripts, providing a glimpse into the workings of Maya governance and society. Under the enlightened rule of the Cocomes dynasty, there was a concerted effort to universalize the practice of codex writing.

Driven from their ancestral homeland, Our people embarked on a journey into the unknown, their footsteps guided by the whispers of the wind and the distant call of the stars. Through the dense undergrowth and the labyrinth of vines, they forged a path into the heart of the jungle, where the verdant expanse of Peten awaited, a realm ripe with untold mysteries and untamed beauty. Here, amidst the shimmering lakes and the hidden cenotes that dotted the landscape like jewels in a crown, our people began anew, a people reborn from the ashes of exile, their spirits undimmed by the trials of fate. With each stroke of the sword and each bead of sweat upon their brow, they carved out a home in this untamed wilderness, their hands weaving the threads of civilization amidst the chaos of nature. The jungle did not yield its secrets easily, for it was a realm of challenges and tests, where the laws of survival reigned supreme. Our people learned the hard way to navigate the labyrinth of the Green Sea, mastering its hidden paths and its treacherous pitfalls, while also harnessing the power of the abundant water that flowed like a lifeline through their new domain. We became “the water witches” stewards of the lakes and guardians of the cenotes, drawing sustenance from the waters that sustained their existence and seeking solace in the tranquil depths of their sacred pools. as we toiled beneath the canopy of green, we forged a bond with the land, a bond as deep and enduring as the roots of the ancient ceiba trees that towered above them."

We are known among our brethren as the "water witches," a title whispered in reverence and awe by our neighbouring tribes and travellers who ventured into our domain. To us however this was no sorcery of dark magic; it was a testament to our profound understanding of the life-giving force that flowed through their world like a silver serpent, the water. From the sacred depths of cenotes hidden beneath the earth to the shimmering surface of lakes that mirrored the heavens above, water coursed through the veins of Itza civilization, sustaining life and nourishing the soul. And it was our people who wielded this elemental power with skill and reverence, like sorcerers conjuring spells from the depths of their wisdom. We carved intricate channels to guide the flow of rivers, constructed reservoirs to capture the precious bounty of the rainy season, and built causeways that spanned the watery expanse, linking our world together like the intricate subterranean rivers that feed the cenotes. One of the few marvels of our people's water magic was the invention of Chinampas or floating islands allowing us to live and farm in the midst of a lake. Our connection to water ran deeper than mere practicality; it flowed through the very fabric of their culture, infusing every aspect of their lives with meaning and magic. In the whispering rush of waterfalls, they heard the voice of the gods; in the shimmering reflections of moonlit lakes, they glimpsed the mysteries of the universe; and in the gentle embrace of raindrops, they felt the pulse of life itself.

Each claimed the city as their own, invoking the deeds of their ancestors and the legacy of their lineage in defence of their claim. For us, Mayapan was not just a city, it was a sacred duty, a responsibility to uphold the legacy of their forebears and safeguard the traditions of their people.

Yet, with meticulous care and an eye for beauty, the Maya crafted their codices written on paper made from the delicate bark of trees. The Maya paper, or amate, was a marvel of craftsmanship, created by shaving thin layers of bark and carefully smoothing them to create a durable and resilient writing surface. Unlike papyrus, which would decay in the humid climate of Mesoamerica, Maya paper withstood the test of time, preserving the words and images of generations past. These codices became the cornerstone of Maya religious and courtly society, serving as repositories of tradition, ritual, and wisdom. Within their pages, scribes meticulously recorded traditions and ceremonies that bound the Maya to their gods and ancestors, ensuring that these sacred traditions would endure for eternity. The codices were not just tools of religious devotion, they also served practical purposes in the administrative and bureaucratic affairs of Maya society. Courtly records, administrative documents, and genealogies were all meticulously recorded in the pages of these precious manuscripts, providing a glimpse into the workings of Maya governance and society. Under the enlightened rule of the Cocomes dynasty, there was a concerted effort to universalize the practice of codex writing. The Cocomes rulers, recognizing the power and potential of the written word, patronised the creation of codices and promoted their use in all levels of Maya society."

For he who controlled Mayapan, Chichen Itza, and Uxmal held the key to half of the Maya population, the most successful trade network after the collapse, and the most vital agricultural and production centres in the Yucatan.

This system, however, required modernization and codification to function within the centralised state envisioned by the new Maya league. At its core, the Kuchkabal system mirrors aspects of European feudalism, with power and authority divided among the elite. However, there are key differences that set it apart. For instance, the administrative and ruling powers are distinct roles, and one individual cannot hold both simultaneously,a departure from European feudalism. Furthermore, a significant social divide exists between the city Maya and the village or tribal Maya. The city Maya form the privileged caste, comprising artisans, nobility, landowners, warriors, priests, and traders. They wield influence and power within the urban centres, shaping the cultural and economic landscape of Maya society. In contrast, the village or tribal Maya serve as the backbone of the economy, toiling in the fields, gathering resources, and transporting goods to the cities. They labour tirelessly to supply the artisans with the raw materials needed for their craft and ensure the smooth functioning of trade routes and commerce. Though their labour may be less visible, they play a crucial role in sustaining the wealth and prosperity of the Maya civilization. As the new Maya league seeks to consolidate power and forge a unified state, the modernization of the Kuchkabal system becomes paramount. By codifying roles and responsibilities, bridging social divides, and fostering cooperation between urban and rural communities, the league aims to build a society that is both strong and equitable, a society where every Maya, regardless of their station, can contribute to the greatness of their civilization."

Uxmal, our most ancient and original capital, with its majestic pyramids and intricately carved stone facades, stands as a testament to the Xiu's architectural prowess. The city flourished under their guidance, its streets bustling with trade and culture, its temples echoing with the prayers of the faithful. Mayapan, another jewel in the Xiu's crown, rose to prominence as a centre of power and learning. Its sprawling urban layout and monumental structures spoke to the Xiu's ability to plan and execute grand civic projects, shaping the destiny of the region for generations to come. Despite our achievements, we faced challenges from rival dynasties, most notably the Cocomes, who would ultimately wrest control of these cities from our grasp. Nevertheless, the legacy of our people endure, their contributions to the urban landscape of Northern Yucatán immortalised in the stone and mortar of Uxmal and Mayapan. As the city builders of Northern Yucatán, we have left an enduring legacy of innovation, our vision shaping the destiny of the region and leaving an indelible mark on the cultural landscape."

To us, agriculture, warfare, and craftsmanship were tasks relegated to those beneath our station, for we are the born rulers of maya society, chosen by the divine to lead. With riches beyond measure, we eschewed the toil of labour, preferring to procure all they needed through the exchange of goods and barter. They looked upon the farmers, warriors, and artisans with indifference, for their hands were better suited to the mastery of trade and governing. Throughout the Maya sphere, our name resonates like a clarion call, a symbol of status and power unrivalled by any other. Our cities teemed with the finest luxuries, their palaces adorned with the trappings of wealth and privilege. Amidst their lofty heights, we were not without challengers. Would-be upstarts and pretender dynasties sought to usurp their power and claim their riches for their own. In the tumult of intrigue and betrayal, we fought to maintain their grip on power, but fate had other plans. Despite our divine mandate and our wealth beyond compare, we found ourselves beset by adversaries both within and without. The very foundations of our dynasty began to crumble, our cities falling to the hands of those who sought to claim their legacy as their own. Mark our words though, as prophecy dictates we are bound to return to power."

Unlike many rulers who raised armies from their own populace, we opted to purchase our troops, drawing upon a vast network of mercenaries to bolster their ranks. Among these hired warriors, none were more favoured than the Mexica tribesmen, known for their disciplined ferocity and unyielding prowess on the battlefield. These fierce warriors were masters of a brutal form of warfare, their tactics honed through centuries of conflict and conquest. What set the Mexica apart, however, was their willingness to go to extremes in the pursuit of victory. It was said that they would offer a reduction in payment if allowed to sacrifice their captives to their god of war, a grisly ritual that involved the consumption of their victims' hearts. While abhorrent to civilised sensibilities, this practice instilled fear and dread in the hearts of their enemies, demoralising them even before the battle had begun. Despite the gruesome nature of their methods, there was no denying the effectiveness of the Mexica warriors in combat. Their disciplined ranks and unrelenting ferocity made them formidable adversaries, capable of turning the tide of battle with a single charge."

At its helm stood our dynasty, our hearts burning with righteous fury at the betrayal of the Cocom dynasty, who had seized control of both Mayapan and Uxmal, cities that rightfully belonged to the Xiu. Leading a coalition of nobles, we embarked on a quest to break the federation of cities that comprised the Mayapan League, a union we saw as an abomination, a perversion of the natural order ordained by the gods themselves. In our eyes, the ancient nobility were meant to rule with total authority, each city sovereign and autonomous, left to its own devices to flourish or falter as fate decreed. With the birth of the Mayapan League came a dangerous idea, that power could be shared among the weak and low-born, diluting the strength and influence of the noble elite. To us and our allies, this was an affront to the very fabric of society, a betrayal of the divine order that had guided their ancestors since time immemorial. So, with banners unfurled and swords raised high, we led our coalition in a rebellion against the Mayapan League, determined to restore the natural order of our society. For them, it was not merely a struggle for territory or riches, but a battle for the soul of the Maya people, a fight to ensure that the strong would prevail and the weak would be cast aside, as dictated by the will of the gods."

These beings would wield weapons that defied the laws of nature, their power transcending our understanding. So it was that one fateful day, the prophecy was fulfilled. Tall ivory-skinned men with hairy faces, clad in garments of myriad colours and eyes that shimmered like the rainbow, arrived upon our shores. In their presence, we knew that the divine army had come at last. Without hesitation, we met these celestial beings and pledged our loyalty to them, recognizing them as emissaries of the gods. In return for our allegiance and the use of our cities as their base, they offered us a promise, the promise of complete control over the Maya, as long as we ruled in the name of Christ and the Crown of Spain, we had no idea what either was. With hearts full of reverence and determination, we agreed to this sacred pact, joining forces with the divine army to once again assert our dominance over the land of the Maya. United under the banner of faith and sovereignty, we embarked on a journey to reclaim our rightful place as the chosen rulers of the Maya, guided by the divine will and the blessings of the gods themselves providing us with weapons and training."

For us, there was no question that if our gods had not sent this army, then we had been following the wrong gods all along. The story of the Lord Jesus Christ resonated with us, his message of salvation and redemption offering a glimpse of a higher power beyond anything our old gods could provide. With unwavering devotion, we embraced this new faith, tearing down our temples and destroying our sacred icons and heretical books. To us, these acts were not sacrilege, but a necessary purification of our beliefs, a casting off of the old to make way for the new. Those who refused to convert were seen as weak and blind, unworthy of the divine blessings bestowed upon us by the celestial army. They were hunted down and dealt with accordingly, for in our eyes, they stood in defiance of the will of god."

We now believe that it was the will of Christ that we, the Xiu dynasty, would rule over the Maya and guide them into the light. The Spanish were merely a vessel used by Christ to deliver this message to us. They have served their purpose, and now it is time for us to cast them aside and embrace our true destiny. We must rid our world of their presence and seize the vision that Christ has entrusted to us. With unwavering faith and determination, we will assert our authority over the land of the Maya and lead our people into a new era of enlightenment and prosperity. It is our divine mandate, and we will not falter in our quest to fulfil it."

Our capital, Xochicalco, flourished as a bustling hub of trade, strategically positioned to control the flow of goods entering the peninsula via rivers and land. Our origins were modest, born as an agricultural and trade colony under the watchful eye of our overlord, Can Pech. However, as the years passed, something remarkable happened. Through diligence and ingenuity, Our people transformed their outpost into a beacon of prosperity, outstripping Can Pech in both productivity and wealth. As our influence expanded, so too did our aspirations. With each passing season, the bonds tethering us to Can Pech grew weaker. Remarkably, this transition was achieved without the spilling of blood. Yoko'tan had become so economically formidable that Can Pech could no longer maintain its grip on the region. And so, with the quiet strength of our prosperity, we peacefully asserted our autonomy, casting off the shackles of their former overlord."

This unconventional choice served us well, for it allowed us to maximise space for farming and production. We erected these houses not only on solid ground but also atop lakes and farmlands, quite literally living above the fish and fields. This innovative method enabled us to construct entire villages atop farmland, minimising the space lost to agriculture. Yet, its benefits extended beyond efficient land use. It provided unexpected protection from the perils of our highland environment. Landslides and mudslides, common occurrences in such terrain due to extensive agriculture, posed less threat to our elevated homes.

In the streets and bustling markets of the city, the ballgame was not just a game but a way of life. Unlike other Maya centres, where the sport was confined to a few courts, Yoko'tan boasted multiple arenas, each a battleground for teams vying for glory. Here, every citizen harboured dreams of stepping onto the sacred court, where skill and strategy could elevate one to legendary status. The ballgame was more than mere competition; it was a deeply ingrained aspect of Chontal Maya culture. Teams formed around soldier volunteers, their ranks swelling with passionate supporters who pledged unwavering allegiance. These loyal followers, with faces painted in the colours of their team, cheered with fervour, their voices echoing through the city streets. With passion came rivalry, and clashes between supporters were not uncommon. The fervour of the ballgame often spilled over into heated confrontations, and on occasion, tempers flared into full-fledged riots, fueled by the agony of defeat and the ecstasy of victory. Despite the occasional unrest, the balgame remained a cherished tradition, a symbol of unity and pride for the people of Yoko'tan."

While our communities thrived on agriculture, boasting unparalleled skill in the cultivation of the land, our primary source of income lay in our mastery over the arteries of commerce. We understand that to wield true power in the region, we needed to assert control over the vital trade routes that crisscrossed the land and rivers. To achieve this, we devised a dual strategy. Firstly, we strategically routed all land routes through our cities, ensuring that any goods travelling to or from Yucatan would pass through our hands. Secondly, we erected river checkpoints, where our watchful sentinels kept a vigilant eye on the waterways, regulating the passage of goods with precision and authority. Through these measures, we established an iron grip over the trade networks of the region, channelling wealth and prosperity into the heart of Yoko'tan. Our control over the flow of commerce became the cornerstone of our power, elevating Xochicalco from a mere capital to a bastion of economic dominance."

Through their meticulous observations, we crafted not only a calendar but a chronicle of time itself, mapping the passage of days and seasons with unparalleled precision. From the subtle shifts in the sun's position to the subtle nuances of its light, they gleaned insights into the rhythms of the natural world, unlocking the mysteries of planting and harvest with each passing cycle.

For them, monogamy wasn't just a societal norm; it was a sacred bond, an unbreakable vow between two souls. In the heart of every one of us dwelled the understanding that they would hold one partner and one partner only, bound by the ties of love and duty. To entertain the thought of seeking another companion after the passing or dissolution of a marriage was not only frowned upon but met with stern disapproval. In some cases, such transgressions against the sanctity of marriage were punished by the harshest of sentences, banishment from the community, a fate feared by all. This unwavering commitment to family forged strong ancestral connections, binding the people of Yoko'tan to their cities with unbreakable bonds of kinship and tradition."

We embraced our role as the breadbasket of Mesoamerica, its surplus foodstuffs flowing like rivers to sustain the hungry masses beyond its borders. From the Maya to the Mexica, none were spared the generosity of Yoko'tan's harvests, though such provisions were not given freely. Indeed, the food that flowed from our fields was not a gift but a commodity, traded and bartered for with the same care and precision as any other treasure. Yet, even as the kingdom enriched itself through commerce, its true wealth lay not in gold or silver but in the sustenance it provided to the hungry and the weary."

One of the two main branches of traditional Indian music, its emphasis on stringed instruments and vocalization represents the heart and soul of south India. While Hindustani music became ever more Persianized, we preserve the true original soul of India."

 hie_krk_humiliate_the_marathas_desc: "The powerful Maratha clan has certainly made their mark on the Deccan and all of India by extension, through their ability to defeat Mughals and colonizers alike. And yet, our lowly, landless horsemen were able to defeat this would-be empire without anyone ever having known our name before. It was because of this great victory that the Emperor of the Mughals, the king of kings, granted us our kingdom. Inshallah, we will ever prove worthy of the title."

They were known in the region as formidable horsemen, even having worshiped a horse-riding warrior god while they were Hindu.

What it originally was was any royal decree issuing a written permission to the royal’s subjects, and could be used for anything from passports and scholarly research to religious exemptions and the setting up of whole states. Our nawab was first granted his title by Firman, forming a written foundation to our state that lays out the duties of the nawab, the responsibilities under both Islamic and Indian laws, and provides a certainty of the laws that proved invaluable to governing the south of India."

Stretching from southern burma all the way through malay straight onto vietnam and southern china. Our dominance came mainly via the establishment of vassal states and trading posts in the are. From which we exercised our control over the region. Establishing great dynasties loyal to us like the srivijayan who were originally of tamil descent. We have long ago lost contact with any of our colonies in the region. And our once strong ally has since been reduced to a mere pirate state.

After which we maintained western connections via our embassies in both cairo and alexandria up until this fell to the ottomans as well.

 hie_mad_war_of_the_noses_desc: "During a particularly brutal war with mysore, a practice developed among southern indian kings. It is not clear who started it but it soon became prevalent all over the indian south. It would involve the cutting off of the noses and lips of captured enemy soldiers, kings, and nobles and keeping them as prestigious trophies of war. The more complete the nos or the set of lips was cut off the more value it had. Speaking to the warrior's skill with their blades. They would hang these noses and lips from their horses and armor to signal their skill as warriors and their veterancy in combat. Meaning the more you had the better of a warrior you were. Driving a sort of minor arms race in the form of experienced soldiers who could prove their prowess in battle through their collections."

These marshalls turned the city and its people into a well-disciplined military state geared for the production and the waging of war. Being great fans of gunpowder weapons they quickly established schools and workshops producing and teaching these weaponry techniques. The nayaks would also begin the push to modernize the army in which they would start to turn away from caste-based warrior groups in favor of teaching the general population how to fight, especially with these modern weapons.

Not so surprising as the renovation of the ancient palace which we taught shared a wall with part of the ancient temple complex. After this wall was torn down a grand discovery was made. A great chola library accidentally sealed away centuries ago. After careful examination, this proved to be a treasure trove of ancient religious texts, long-lost crafting techniques, and incredibly valuable literary relics like one of the original buddha scrolls. But most importantly ancient techniques for things like the legendary chola ships and temple constructions. This great discovery made it so that we could finally unlock these elusive secrets thought lost to time, the time of a greater age.

 hie_tnj_bane_of_the_europeans_desc: "We have seen the europeans pop up, especially those that call themselves portuguese and dutch. For example, to our south on the island of ceylon, the portuguese brought the 500 year rule of the kingdom of kotte to an end. This made the kingdom of jaffa call for aid for all that would heed their call. We did and showed up in force. The portuguese did not expect an army armed with guns and canons like there was. This took them completely by surprise and in less than 2 weeks. The thanjavur and jaffans combined army drove them off the island. This victory made it so that the dutch who arrived after the portuguese were forced into signing a treaty with us out of fear the same might happen to them. Coming to a trade agreement that is more beneficial to us than to them. We would also provide stiff resistance and succeeded in fighting the french and british in later years. While clear that unlike in the case of the portuguese wars we in fact could not win these, our military reputation and prowess made it so we could argue for extremely favorable terms with both empires maintaining our independence at the cost of loyalty."

Reformed our government in that of a modern india state. We rise from the ashes and ready to face whatever comes next. We have endured for millennia, we shall endure for millenia more."

This combination of experience brought about a very efficient if somewhat cold hearted government. This government was set up to try and rebuild any form of cohesion and functionality and that it did indeed achieved. it came at the cost of the people tho with the hindus being treated as effective outcast and free labor why muslims where effectively elevated to the nobility regardless of former cast or status. creating a stable and efficient if not dogmatic regime."

Prior to the fall of the sultanate or “shah” as they liked to call themselves, our rulers were governors of Berar with the center of power being located in the citadel of Gawilghur. From here, just like the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, we would also declare our independence as governors sensing the impending total collapse of the state. We would be branded traitors by a lot of people; however, we saw it as maintaining stability for our people who were suffering under the vice of a desperate imploding state. Our quick action and determination not only meant we had a stable realm but one that could actually hold itself against outside invasions and influences."

There, he was adopted by the sultan himself and raised a muslim. This example was continued by our nobility, our first sultan proved it was a good way to not only bring more souls into the light of allah, but it also helped to expand the muslim ruling class which was severely outnumbered in the sultanate by the Hindu non-nobility majority. it would become common practice that every Muslim noble would adopt at least one orphan in his lifetime. Either to become an heir for the heirless or to have a protege that would be raised to be a chancellor, marshal, steward, personal bodyguard, and so on. This could vary from anything like a martial, diplomatic, religious education. all the way to administration research and so much more. These adopted orphans become a vital pillar to our high society, often being the strong leadership behind our military and state as governors, generals, advisors and viceroys."

During his time as governor he built the majority of the region's forts and fortified major mountains and hills to control the movement of people and trade through the river valleys. thes first were major works being among the finest and most cost effective in all of india. Due to our geography this became vital to us and the fort became a source of cultural pride ever looking to improve what's already there. eventually being among the first in the world to incorporate cannons in defensive structures which lended itself greatly to the way our first were built, extending their effective range greatly due to the geographic locations of the forts."

Since both served as the palaces of the sultan, switching both between summer and winter place depending on the preferences of the current sultan. These beautiful and military impressive forts would never fall by an Indian army. Only when the severely more scientifically advanced British showed up would these forts fall to a siege. These first were also connected by a shared underground aqueduct so if one fell they could shut off the water to the other fort which was only known by the ones who built it of course. This underground aqueduct also had the benefits of communication. the would sell messages or goods like food or other floatables in wax making it water tight and sending it down the aqueduct.

While this was never fully realised, mainly due to the rise of prominence of the mughal empire and their subjugation of many of the sultanates, for a decade this system led by Berar achieved what it set out to do. Which was to stabilize the Deccani region under stable undivided Muslim rule uniting the sultans in a common goal.

In the case of crisis the Divan often functioned more as a council to curb set crises and amass an army if needed in the case of war or rebellion. Lastly during a state visit the Divan acted more as a diplomatic mission and a chance to show off the empire at the court to impress both emperor and foreign dignitary or ruler. this is what the Divan does for the empire the Divan for us Newabs is something different entirely it is a place where we can command the internal functions and directions of the empire a place where we as Newabs forge our alliances and voting blocks to gain as much support for what we need from the emperor. elegantly combining governance of the empire with strengthening our own personal influence and control."

This comes regardless of the original culture in which this persianate society adopts. What happens is that the original culture starts to adopt the persian language culture and religious practices and hybridizes it with their own. Now that we have the technical aspect down, we can talk about what this meant to the people of golkonda in practice. While persian did indeed become the language of the nobility and the court the language in itself did not become widely spread. What did happen was the control of the hindu faith and the dominance of the shia faith in higher society while hindus could no longer publicly observe their faith and temple visits being only allowed on certain dates.

These ministers were the minister of the treasury, the minister of finance and a grand marshal. These respectively controlled every form of the government from trade taxation, policing , the economy and so on. What it did not include however was the army.

These initial defensive cannoneers have since learned to adapt their skills to the battlefield, creating one of the most efficient and hard hitting canon tactics of the sub content. They would bring the cannon in front of the army bombarding the enemy as they approached. When the enemy came to close the army itself would move in front of the canons. The canons would then reposition to the flanks or elevated position decimating the enemy back line and picking off routing troops. This modern artillery core combined with our cavalry and our gunpowder infantry would create a deadly combo of overlapping fields of fire with a mobile element to chase down the remaining enemy troops."

This made religion in the Maldives divided among class lines with the traders and high nobility being muslim and the artisans and low nobility buddhist. creating a unique climate of dependency among the religions. the Muslim traders relied on the buddhist artisans for their goods and vice versa did the buddhist artisans rely on the muslim traders for materials. while the high nobility required the support of the buddhist low nobility to maintain control and stability in the realm."

These ministers were the minister of the treasury, the minister of finance and a grand marshal. These respectively controlled every form of the government from trade taxation, policing , the economy and so on. What it did not include however was the army.

However, as we grow as a state and our access to trade abroad increases, our rulers saw the wisdom in creating a standard weight gold coin which would remain unchanged in value for centuries, making our currency the most trustworthy in all of southern India."

The clergy quickly began to foment unrest among the people in retaliation, so we came up with an ingenious if harsh way of dealing with them. Inviting them all to a feast, we then had them exit one by one through a narrow hallway, whereupon a royal wrestler would strangle each in turn. This had the curious effect of stopping any further rioting."

Our realm has mastered this; by making situational friends with stronger powers around us and keeping them all at ease, we are able to grow our own power base undisturbed."

However, as we were able to fight hard enough to buy time, our people have used this time wisely. Unlike other Indian rulers, who arrogantly assumed that Europeans could not defeat their large armies, we focused on closing the gap in the new artillery technology wielded by Europeans, and even surpassing them. We pioneered iron-casting techniques for our cannons that none of our enemies had and incorporated old Chinese rocketry with new European cannons, making an artillery corps that was unequaled in India."

His most lasting reform, and the one that granted him the name Sher-e-Mysore (Tiger of Mysore), was rallying his people to expel the European colonizers, pioneering artillery tactics and catching up in artillery technology to do so. So famous became his exploits that a mechanical toy was created to commemorate his exploits, showing a life-sized European man being devoured by the Tiger of Mysore."

We would expand and renovate the ancient fort to fit our needs, using it more like a vault and fortress to keep our family safe in case of a war that threatens our capital of nagpur. It has the advantage of being hidden away on a densely forested set of mountains making it not only hard to find but hard to siege as well. it would also function as some sort of a summer palace. an opulent place where the royal family could get away from the reality of ruling one of the last independent states between the empires of the muslims and the Europeans in india."

This was their profession, they couldn't be bought, they wouldn't offer their services to anyone else but to the rightful hindu leadership of India. After the fall of the confederation, this title according to them fell onto us offering their services to us. These Bagri were distinct from almost all of the cavalry in this part of the world. in the way that most cavalry would provide their own horse weapons and armor, being called the Shiledars. While Bagri quite literally means those who are armed by the state. They were a very effective form of light cavalry who specialized in preparing an area for invasion. They would swoop in mass loot cities and villages while harassing supply lines and their ability to gather levies. During their raids into the Bengali sultanate, they proved so effective at their job that mothers started to write lullabies warning their kids to beware and behave or the maharatti Bargi cavalry would come to get them and murder the entire village."

Thanks to the help we got from the British we managed to expand further north into Kerala.

While the realm of Yaroslav would contain the north and north west of the Rus principalities. Utilizing the Dnieper as their main hard border so there would be no discussion on where the border lay. This marked the birth of the first diplomatic treaty and agreement within the world of the Rus.

The record gives an idea how the aristocratic Rus carried themselves in diplomatic engagements. This proves that the Rus are in diplomacy much the same as in battle: ruthless , unyielding and stubborn. It proved that both sides wouldn't budge unless their position of strength was destabilized. This would be very contradictory to the western conciliatory system.

Due to the fragmentation of Poland a century earlier, Siesia had been politically divided between lords supporting the claim of Bohemia over the region and Poland. In 1333 they came to an agreement that did three things: it ceded the region to the Bohemian crown, the Polish crown would get in a promise of submission of the Teutonic Order as their dejure overlord and the Rulers of Bohemia would renounce their claim to Poland via the Premyslid dynasty and their many royal marriages with the Piast dynasty. This would indeed make Silesia part of Bohemia but the Piast dynasty ruling over Silesia would still be the most legitimate claimant to the Polish throne."

Over the centuries this entire hill would be built into a castle/palace/cathedral complex. One of the greatest in Europe, in fact, it wasn't only a defensive center for the city but it had become the center of it all as well.

These fortified towns and castles dotted the Polish landscape. One of the most famous examples are cities like Gdansk, Krakow, and Poznan. These were integral for the sole reason they kept everyone safe in the tumultuous land that was Poland of old and later on helped to safeguard the populations during wars, and they are a vital part of our defense.

Not only that, it became our way of doing diplomacy with other catholic realms.

More and more over time did Moscow grow ever dependent on us. Which would spar a legend about our name with a name literally meaning the new grand city. Some say  it's a reference to how the city was literally new and born out of nothing but the most accepted theory is that we really only got this name after we had been bound to moscow and become the new city or the new part of the grand city."

These chronicles purport to tell of the earliest origins of the ancestor state of today's Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. According to the First Novgorod Chronicle, the local inhabitants of the eastern Baltic region (today's northern European Russia) cast out the Scandinavian warriors (Varangians) who had oppressed them and forced them to pay tribute.

It stood on the northwestern end of the Silk Road from China and at the eastern end of the Baltic trade network established by the Hanseatic League. From Novgorod's northeastern lands ("The Lands Beyond the Portages" as they were called in the chronicles), the area stretching north of Lakes Ladoga and Onega up to the White Sea and east to the Ural Mountains had so much fur that medieval travel accounts tell of furry animals raining from the sky. The Novgorodian merchants traded with Swedish, German, and Danish cities. In early years, the Novgorodians sailed the Baltic themselves (several incidents involving Novgorodian merchants in Gotland and Denmark are reported in the Novgorodian First Chronicle). Orthodox churches for Novgorodian merchants have been excavated on Gotland. Likewise, merchants from Gotland had their own St. Olaf church and trading house in Novgorod. However the Hanseatic League disputed the right of the Novgorod merchants to carry out sea trade independently and to deliver cargoes to the West-European ports by their own ships."

The Volkhov River divided the Republic of Novgorod into two-halves. The commercial side of the city, which contained the main market, rested on one side of the Volkhov. The St. Sophia Cathedral and an ancient kremlin rested on the other side of the river. The cathedral and kremlin were surrounded by a solid ring of city walls, which included a bell tower. Novgorod was filled with and surrounded by churches and monasteries. The Byzantine style (famous for large domes) and the European Romanesque style influenced the architecture of Novgorod. A number of rich families commissioned churches and monasteries in the city. About 83 churches, almost all of which were built in stone, operated during this period."

 hie_nov_zavolochye_desc: "The main postulate in ancient Russian history is the two waves of Novgorodian colonization of Zavolochye, as a result of which the Russians mastered the North. The beginning of colonization refers to the period of the calling of the Varangians in 862 and the reign of the descendants of Rurik in Ladoga, Belozero and Polotsk. First, military detachments of Novgorodians, the Ushkuiniki, penetrated into the Vazha region along the rivers on their light boats. Their task was to break the resistance of the local natives and establish their strongholds on this land - graveyards. Merchants followed the Ushkuin warriors, then feudal lords who bought up land. The Novgorodians were interested in hunting grounds rich in furs, collecting tribute and rich booty from the conquered Chud population. In the end, all this was sanctified by the noble goal of Orthodox missionary work, the desire to bring the divine light of Christianity to the wild tribes. Finally, migrant peasants rushed to new territories, unable to survive in their homeland due to the small area of cultivated land. Fugitive people also came to Zavolochye, for some reason forced to flee from Novgorod and the Rostov-Suzdal principality."

In 1333 they came to an agreement that did three things: it ceded the region to the Bohemian crown, the Polish crown would get in a promise of submission of the Teutonic Order as their dejure overlord and the Rulers of Bohemia would renounce their claim to Poland via the Premyslid dynasty and their many royal marriages with the Piast dynasty.

In a document of 1341, he guaranteed the followers of the Orthodox Church respect for their rites and customs. Thanks to this attitude of King Casimir, Poland became the first multi-confessional state in Europe where the royal court was Catholic. Tolerance for schismatics, however, did not extend to heresies originating in the Catholic Church. King Władysław Jagiełło's 1424 edict of Wielun declared Hussitism a crime against the state. But in the same century, the Orthodox nobility enjoyed the same privileges as the Catholic nobility, as did the Armenians.

The document was signed in the castle in the town of Krewo on 14 August 1385. The Polish nobility had long been dissatisfied with the dynastic union with Hungary (realized through the succession of Louis I of Hungary to Casimir III the Great). In addition, shared interests with Lithuania, such as opposition to the Teutonic Knights and the growing threat posed by the Principality of Moscow, convinced the leaders of the two states to join forces to better counter external threats. Ladislaus II Jagellon (as he was called after his baptism) and Hedwig of Anjou ruled together over the new state of Poland and Lithuania, but in the Grand Duchy effective power was exercised by the king's cousin Vitoldo, who pursued a policy of substantial independence from Krakow. After the death of Queen Hedwig in 1399, Ladislaus Jagiellon remained the sole ruler of Poland and the first of the Jagiellonian dynasty. His command of the Polish-Lithuanian armed forces was crucial in the defeat of the Teutonic Knights at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410."

The territorial basis of the concept of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland included the Polish lands united by Władysław the Short and Casimir the Great, i.e. the lands constituting the state, but apart from that the concept of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland also included historically Polish lands (i.e. such lands which used to be part of the Kingdom of Poland, but were not now in the united kingdom) and ethnically Polish lands (i.e. lands with a Polish-speaking population).

This agreement was one of the acts commissioned by Sigismund II Augustus, the last monarch of the Jagellon dynasty: he believed he could preserve his dynasty by adopting an elective monarchy, but his death in 1572 was followed by a three-year interregnum during which adjustments were made to the constitutional system; these adjustments significantly increased the power of the Polish nobility and established a truly elective monarchy."

In addition to large landowners, small knights, voyty and soltys had their units under the "zemskyy horyvnia". The militia from the eastern borders, where the local nobility often defended their lands against Tatar raids, was the most effective. Zemsky Khrugwai (Land Knights) also recruited free burghers and Polish peasants in person. They were called "pospolitnye Cossacks". In the XV century, the right to declare a ruling was transferred from a king to a Sejm. This restricted the monarchs' possibilities to conduct military actions outside Poland in narrow dynastic interests. Deprived of the right to declare a general mobilization, the king began to attract mercenaries from other countries of Europe and the Zaporizhzhia Cossacks. In addition, in the sixteenth century, a permanent army was formed in Poland - the Quartet Army."

Three years later the Sejm established the first hussar banners, financed by the Republic of Poland. However, it was not until the mid-16th century that hussars became the main force of the Polish army. However, the shape and appearance of hussars as we know them today did not take shape until after 1577, when the army of Stefan Batory ended the war with the city of Gdansk. The years of hussar's splendor began in 1598 and then gradually decreased as a percentage of the Polish army. In the times of Batory hussars constituted as much as 90 percent of horse cavalry, in the years 1600-1605 it was already 60-70 percent and in the years 1627-1633 only 40-50 percent."

However, it was used for other purposes. In 1477 a project of maintaining 7000 cavalry and 1000 infantry in the south-eastern borderlands was put forward at the Piotrków congress, and a permanent tax was proposed for this purpose. At the beginning of 1479, the general command of the common defense was exercised by the hetman of the enlisted troops, Jan Polak Karnkowski. At that time letters of command were issued for sixteen infantry rotas and seventeen cavalry flags. In total the infantry consisted of about 1200 soldiers and 60 horses, the cavalry of about 900 horses. On November 2, 1492, letters of commendation were issued to six rotes for 1024 cavalry. In 1493 the common defense numbered 1500 cavalry. In 1497 its troops took part in the Moldavian expedition of Jan Olbracht."

It would remain in this position until the late 15th centuries when the Lithuanians started building their far more modern fortifications with the help of teutonic engineers. Even then it would be an impressive fortification; its location between two wide rivers made it nearly impossible to siege until the invention of modern canon and its vast multi level segmented fortifications meant that even if one line fell there would be many more to breach. The fact it was rumored to be protected by magic also helped to make invading armies ignore it on principle, saving the surrounding cities of Polotsk, vitabisk and minsk from falling under attack many times.

He came north to further realize the dream of his father to establish a true and flourishing kingdom for the Rus under God. This was the reasoning given to push the border of his brother's realm, the realm of Yaroslav the wise. Mstislav established a monastery that functioned as the administrative center for his newly founded realm. Whether he erected this expansion over spite that Yaroslav got the greater inheritance or if it was truly in fulfillment of the divine plan of his father is still up for debate."

This would come at a great cost though our real growth would not happen until the sacking of kiev. The fall of Kiev was a great boon to us however terrible this sounds. Thousands of refugees came to us being so insignificant we were effectively ignored by the Mongols and subsequently spared the ravage of the hoard. This would make it so that our city would be flooded by people all over the Russian sphere with this influx of people, ideas and sets of skills.

Mstislav sent emissaries to the court of Yaroslav and established Chernigov and the eastern dnieper bank as the border of his realm therefore the western bank would be his. Yaroslav adjusted this and said he would agree only if Chernigov would be Mstislav's most northern outpost. So it came to be that the realm of Mstislav would contain the south and south eastern of the Rus principalities. While the realm of Yaroslav would contain the north and north west of the Rus principalities. Utilizing the Dnieper as their main hard border so there would be no discussion on where the border lay. This marked the birth of the first diplomatic treaty and agreement within the world of the Rus. The agreement that Mstislav and Yaroslav reached that day is in effect the birth of diplomacy among the Rus.

It was said even the Mongols were afraid when they gazed on the walls of Chernigov.

The civil war in itself isn't all that important; it's a dime a dozen. The importance itself lies in that it is one of the first documented internal councils. The record gives an idea how the aristocratic Rus carried themselves in diplomatic engagements. This proves that the Rus are in diplomacy much the same as in battle: ruthless , unyielding and stubborn. It proved that both sides wouldn't budge unless their position of strength was destabilized. This would be very contradictory to the western conciliatory system. The russ would employ this without fault only negotiating out of some position of strength and if your opponents were in a superior position you would find a way to destabilize that position either by war and combat or by backroom politics and subterfuge."

The Cuman federation was going west and would require a coordinated response to hold off and maintain our autonomy.

In 1333 they came to an agreement that did three things: it ceded the region to the Bohemian crown, the Polish crown would get in a promise of submission of the Teutonic Order as their dejure overlord and the Rulers of Bohemia would renounce their claim to Poland via the Premyslid dynasty and their many royal marriages with the Piast dynasty.

This chronicle became not only one of the most famous read stories among our higher nobility but sections of it were being told during mass.

But it went beyond that we would establish a grand foundry which would be the biggest of Europe for centuries to come. And a grand arsenal where we could stock thousands of them.

While also not being a major political center like the capital of an empire or a big kingdom. Smolensk was just a very rich principality that via trade garnered way too much gold then to know what to do with it. So they started to make their own currency which provided two benefits. Eastern Europe prior to the formation of Russia counted exactly three minutes. One in Kiev which was a remnant of the Kievan Rus and which produced the currency virtually used by everyone west of poland. The Lithuanian mint in vilnius produced a coin to safeguard the independence of their economy for their vassals and themselves. And lastly the smolensky mint which was the coin used for the russians even after the formation of ivan the terrible russia. This did two things for Smolensk: first they effectively controlled the monetary policy and capabilities of the Russian princedoms. Making them incredibly dominant politically and diplomatically. Secondly it meant that Smolensk would effectively be protected by all dependent on its mint for currency since no other Russian prince had neither the resources nor the infrastructure to set up a mint of themselves. This would remain this way until the Polish siege and subsequent capture in 1611."

What to some might seem as betrayal and self serving is to us how diplomacy works especially when you find yourself in our position. We don't really field an army, we let our allies field one for us. Either that or we employ mercenaries. But our interpretation of an alliance is that we swear fealty to a greater military power that then keeps us safe so we can conduct what we do best. Create products from our artisans and conduct trade on one of Europe's busiest trade routes. In return we would greatly compensate and support our new “allie” with resources and monetary support. But this also means that this only works as long as we actually feel protected. If we dont we will go looking somewhere else for a “allie” that does appreciate what it is we bring to the table."

But for us he was a grand innovator who managed to keep the peace but stand up for his people when necessary. His image and sainthood would become the example of what a prince of Tver should strive to. Baking these traits as culturally important in the tverian people.

Its the practice of installing a family member on a vassal's throne ensuring not only loyalty and aid by familial bond. It would also be the practice upon the death of the current prince the appanages would be reintegrated and reestablished by the next prince. This had multiple advantages: it would centralize the realm by decentralizing it. Placating the estates for local control via the authority of the apanage vassal. while having the vassal be the final authority within his realm regarding taxation and levies as long as they paid their share in both to the grand prince. This would mean everyone had enough to rule, govern and maintain local defence while maintaining the and funding the grand principality all at the same time.

However for all his reforming he could not stand against the numbers of the golden horde he would choose to rebel against. As one of the first to openly defy the authority of the horse while all the other princes were too afraid to fight we did. We stood up for ourselves and our liberty. We paid for it in blood though our rebellion failed and our great prince was killed with his eldest son. We like to believe that we sparked the flame that would start the fire.

This innovation would also come at a fortuitous timing: by adapting Orthodoxy and Western models, the Uniate Church, centered in Ruthenia, experienced an intellectual blossoming that allowed it to withstand the intellectual, theological, and educational challenge of the Reformation.

This caused a great move north to the then village of Suzdal which then grew out to the new capital of the realm.

One is to provide able bodied man for the guard of the principality and one in taxes based on the amount of gold gained in raids and trade.This would be far more beneficial to us then to spend time, money and resources to subjugate, maintain and build up these new conquered lands.

Here in the cuman federation is where the “cosac” is born. In this codex it is explained that the cosac are a nomadic warrior class of non-Cuman descent. Meaning that anyone fighting for the cuman federation that wasn't cuman per definition is a cosac. A majority of these cosacs turned out to be slavic mercenaries who decided to settle down within the Cuman state. Thus making the cosac a majority slavic orthodox group that employed Turcic and Mongol tactics. This in effect created a hybrid culture in which western traditions such as christianity and slavic traditions are combined with mongol style warfare, a nomadic lifestyle and a Turcic elective democracy. It also goes into depth how there are two majorities in this cuman cosac class. One would be the Western cosacs, which where majority slavic and christian would be known as the cossacks, and the eastern cossacks were majority Tatar and Muslim and would be known as the Khazak."

This meant there would always  be  a rotating population within the Stanytsia either for church or to train or report for military duty.

He would over time fall in love with the cossacks and would actually join them converting from catholic to orthodox and becoming a nomad himself. He then went on to successfully beat the Polish Lithuanian commonwealth and gain recognition from the tsardom of russia for his independent state of Zaporozka Sich. He would then go on to modernize cossack society by inviting the Jesuits to educate his people as long as they stayed within the confines of what was accepted by the orthodox church. The equal nature of cossack society made it so that men and women were equally educated. He would introduce them to the use of canons and modern gunpowder weapons like grenades and modern rifles.he would even introduce ship building and modern farming techniques to the cossacks.

These would not only serve as a clear reminder of the border, to deter and intimidate the enemy invaders.

 hie_kor_gwageo_desc: "Gwageo was based on the civil service examinations of imperial China. The system initially made its appearance in Unified Silla, gained importance in Goryeo, and was the center of the educational system during the Joseon dynasty. The tutelage provided by the hyanggyo, seowon, and seonggyungwan was primarily intended to prepare students for gwageo and their subsequent careers in government service. Under the Joseon dynasty, young men who were not the sons of officers of the second rank or above were not eligible for senior positions unless the candidate had passed the gwageo. Those who passed the higher literary examination monopolized all the top positions in the state."

The Hongmungwan in particular replaced the abolished Hall of Worthies and served to advise the king. While modeled after the Chinese system of Censorate, they played much more prominent roles in the Joseon government than their Chinese counterparts, and are credited for an absence of abuse by eunuchs and other corruptible officials."

 hie_kor_geobukseon_desc: "The first mention of a Geobukseon can be found in the Korean annals of 1413, where a battle between one of them and a Japanese ship is mentioned. However, this type of ship seems to have subsequently fallen into oblivion, until it was rediscovered and refined by Yi Sun-sin, Korea's famous admiral and national hero. Yi Sun-sin's kobukson was a large, two-masted, oar-powered ship with loopholes for bows, cannons, and mortars, the ability to launch flaming material and a sharp-pointed deck as an anti-boarding measure, as well as being considerably larger than her Japanese counterparts, who were always outnumbered. The kobukson was derived from the earlier panokseon, the Korean standard during the Imjin War with Japan."

 hie_kor_silhak_desc: "The beginnings of this reform in the 17th century, during the period of reconstruction of the country after the wars, and under the Joseon dynasty. Silhak could be translated as "practical studies". The precursors of sirhak were encyclopaedists, such as Heo Jun who compiled all the medicinal science of his time. Yi Ik, another precursor, created a sort of counter-mandarine college by specializing in a wide range of political and social studies. This movement was opposed to the neo-Confucian tradition, which had come to lose itself in metaphysical discussions, in 'Byzantine quarrels', which clumsily concealed their appetite for power. The country experienced an important development in the eighteenth century, thanks in large part to the involvement of certain scholars in the silhak movement."

By adding political and military privileges, Henry IV greatly reduced protestant upset and bring (civil) peace through France. Everything could have stayed that way, but Louis XIV decided otherwise. Henry IV's grandson aimed a religious uniformity in his kingdom. After offering financial incentives to convert, he decided in 1681 to take a more... active path to convince them. By billeting dragoons and infantrymen in protestant homes with an order to harass and intimidate occupants, the policy was undoubtedly more efficient than the diplomatic way. After some years and some burned churches, the Huguenots massively fled to Switzerland, Dutch Republic, and Germany. Louis XIV won his bet, and France would henceforth be Catholic."

One of the few regimes in late medieval Europe that could be called benevolent, the Burgundian State founded the Estates-General of The Low Countries as a guarantor of those rights and a way for the citizens both noble and common to have representation before the king. This created the first unified parliament of the Low Countries and parliamentary governance would forever more be the preferred government of the Low Countries."

With this large number of archbishops backing our cause, we can effectively control the curia elections and enforce our control over the pope.

Which for its time was quite the fortification. Then in 1300, the secondary defensive ring was finished. The initial trench was expanded into a canal system which helped with the defense of the outer city. It created easy-to-defend islands and sections to more easily lock down the outer city in case of a wall breach of the first perimeter.

It's combination of Romanesque and Gothic and of French and German was unique, as was its beautiful pink sandstone construction from the unique stones of the area. It quickly became the cultural pinnacle of the Alsace region, both spiritually and physically.

Unusually for the period, the church and the burgeoning middle class worked together instead of at loggerheads, setting up these factories as joint enterprises. There, a stable working environment with the moderating influence of the church combining with the rigorous standards of the guilds and merchants would create a uniquely productive working class in the city.

Language, architecture (including the eponymous cathedral), cuisine, music, and more all illustrated this. Alsatian culture, centered in Straßburg, has much of the refined daintiness of high French culture while maintaining the chutzpah that characterizes German states. Neither German nor French, and yet both; Straßburg is truly a place that knows how to become a melting pot."

The first printing presses outside Mainz were set up here in 1460, and we quickly saw the potential for this enterprise, printing books including the Bible here early on. Later, we would become the first city in the world to host a printed newspaper, the Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien."
 hie_als_religious_agreements: "Religious Agreements"

We were one of the first places to publish Luther's 95 Theses, and in general any dissenting religious opinion is tolerated so long as it does not threaten the peace of the city. This would be born out by several charters and agreements written here. The Wittenberg Agreement, the result of an aborted attempt to reconcile Lutherans and Reformed, would outline the difference between them in an amicable way; Anabaptists were invited to settle here after being ousted elsewhere; and, religious disputes were settled by debate rather than violence, such as in the Straßburger Kapitelstreit which lasted from 1583 to 1604, in which Catholicism was able to peacefully gain some ground back from Lutheranism and Calvinism, although the city would remain majority Protestant."
 hie_als_confessio_tetrapolitana: "Confessio Tetrapolitana"

One of the first major Reformers after Luther, Martin Bucer, quickly rose to prominence as the city's spiritual leader. He would become the mentor of a certain Jean Calvin. He would become a major influencing figure in Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Anglicanism. In addition, prominent early Anabaptists such as Melchior Hoffman, whose followers would eventually become the Mennonites, were allowed to give input. The culmination of this intense but peaceful exchange of ideas led to the Confessio Tetrapolitana, where Straßburg and three other cities produced their own confession of faith and submitted it to the Imperial Diet along with the Augsburg Confession of more strict Lutheranism. Holding a mediating position between Luther and the early Reformed, such as Zwingli, it is seen as simultaneously a Lutheran and an early Reformed confession, illustrating perfectly that Straßburg was as much a beating heart of the Reformation and its theology as Wittenberg or Geneva."

The city itself can be said to be a bridge of Europe, straddling the mighty river Rhine between West and Central Europe. This metaphorical bridging was physically reinforced in 1250 with the completion of the Gedeckte Brugen in 1250, which was a set of four bridges reinforced with roofs, strong towers, and gatehouses to safeguard the entrance to the Holy Roman Empire. Over the centuries, Germanic, French, and other armies passed through here and fought over the city, each one fortifying it more than the last. We are truly the bastion of the Rhine, and arguably one of the most strategic cities in the world because of it."

It was built because it surpassed the tidal reliance that was needed to sail up the Weser to Bremen itself. It was quite literally that a port it only later grew out to an extension of the city itself when dock workers started to move there to live in closer proximity to their work.

Ever since then, the bishop has tried to reassert its control over us and then wanted a piece of us. Our neighbor, sensing weakness, also tried to gain a piece of Bremer land.

This would kick start the German interest in a colonial empire sending their first explorers and colonial ships from Bremen. This caused a significant interest in Bremen and especially Bremerhaven making it the first truly lucrative German trading port regarding global trade. Quickly dwarfing its main rival in Hamburg which would become more of a military-focused port."

 hie_brg_via_media: "Via Media"
 hie_brg_via_media_desc: "A term used to describe the rule of John the “peaceful” in which he described his stance on the reformation. Meaning that he considered himself a catholic but highly sympathetic to the points made by the Reformation. This would make him extremely popular with tolerant reformists and Catholics which on both sides was harder to find than you think. Later popes would use him as an example of what it meant to be a post-trent catholic. This vision however would mean he was very diplomatically connected on both sides of the reformation. Marrying one of his daughters to the von Wettin elector of Saxony and another to the staunchly catholic von Wittelsbachs of Bavaria and the Palatinate. One of the major drivers behind this “Via Media” was the presence of Erasmus at his court who fed into John's interest in the humanities. This would make his court one of the main centers in the Holy Roman Empire where these ideas of the reformation and humanities could be openly discussed and where the discussion of them was openly encouraged. This trend would from then on always be present in both the Catholic and Protestant sides of the family and would be a great source of pride."

Where valleys like the Whupper were pioneers in medieval industries the Ruhr valley which is rich in coal will now lead the way in this modern industrial revolution. Valleys like the whupper would follow suit with the industrialisation of the cloth industry.

In any case Luther had fallen in love with the castle, the city and the surrounding nature and requested a permanent study here in the castle. Every time he would visit, bringing with him an entourage of Lutheran scholars, believers and theologians.

The Salian counts of Franconia held this imperial title, as well as that of Franconia, for over two centuries, and it maintained its status as a key imperial fief ever after. We shall never forget our glory days, the days when imperial lineages called Franconia home."
 hie_fkn_inextinguishable_title: "Inextinguishable Title"
 hie_fkn_inextinguishable_title_desc: "Even after a rebellion by its proud people forced the Emperor to dissolve the duchy itself in the 10th century, the title itself remained a key part of the Empire. Its constituent counts reported directly to the Emperor and thus the region became an important power base for the empire. Because of this, the title was never abolished as others were, being kept preserved until such time as it was needed. Because of the need to preserve these legal ramifications, the Franconian rulers must know more about their own governance and realms than other princes."
 hie_fkn_knights_franconian_orders: "Knights of the Franconian Orders"
 hie_fkn_knights_franconian_orders_desc: "From the bases of the Teutonic Order governed from outside the empire to the Imperial Knights who report directly to the Emperor, the knightly class and its orders has an outsized influence in the region of Franconia. Indeed, the Imperial Knighthood is almost exclusive to Swabia and Franconia, and many of medieval Europe's most prestigious orders, including the Teutonic Knights, recruited and operated here. Nowhere in Europe are the medieval knighthood so protected and prosperous as in our lands, and this gives us a ready supply of leadership and elite forces for our armies."
 hie_fkn_curb_raubritter: "Curb the Raubritter"
 hie_fkn_curb_raubritter_desc: "In the 16th century, the Raubritter, robber barons, were a particular plague of the disunited Franconian region. Made up of disaffected or impoverished knights and their followers, these barons wreaked havoc on our lands as the authorities were initially helpless to contain them. Holed up in their many small castles spread out across the land, they could defy law and order almost indefinitely. Now that we have centralized into one Franconian state, we finally can bring our will to bear on these thieves. In doing so, our men will crack open every keep and fortress until we laugh at the sight of their pitiful walls."
 hie_fkn_franconian_reformation: "Franconian Reformation"
 hie_fkn_franconian_reformation_desc: "While the Reformation started in Saxony and took off in the North, Franconia became its beating heart. Taking in persecuted Reformers from neighboring regions, then sending their ideas back out again via the printing press, the impact of this shift in our realm has been profound, making us an influential intellectual center as well as one of faith."
 hie_fkn_nichtabgeschlossenes_gebiet: "Nichtabgeschlossenes Gebiet"
 hie_fkn_nichtabgeschlossenes_gebiet_desc: "Literally translated as “Non-contiguous area” or “terrotorium non clausum,” this refers to the peculiar geographic divides among Franconian lands. While the Holy Roman Empire in general is noted for its many exclaves and enclaves, nowhere else in the world do lines on a map mean so little as far as determining who owns what. Because of this, we have become used to operating in conditions which would befuddle others, and this frees our hand at expansion via subjugation in ways other realms cannot."
 hie_fkn_franconian_brewing_expterise: "Franconian Brewing Expertise"
 hie_fkn_franconian_brewing_expterise_desc: "Franconia has long had the highest concentration of breweries and brew houses in the world. On top of that, our climate is perfect for barley for beer and grapes for wine to grow side-by-side. While some swampy people further downriver may claim to make the best beer, or some loudmouths over the Alps claim to make the best wine, our dual expertise makes it indisputable. We are the masters of brewing, and it is a great source of pride and contentment for all who call Franconia home."

And would later be inhabited by the southern franks who would name the place Frankonovurd. These ruins of nida would remain in place and untouched in a place dubbed by the locals Hedderheim or heathen realm. Starting in the 15th century however what started out as a frankish town ship expanded into a for its time gigantic city and would use the ruins as cheap and quick building materials."

 hie_frn_council_frankfurt_desc: "This council was effectively the first western and non-roman held synod. As a response to two things. The first one being the growing popularity of adoptionism in umayyad heald iberia. Secondly to the secondly a reaction to the second council of Nicea in which iconoclasm was addressed. Charlemagne was very insulted that none of his frankish bishops or clergy was invited so he held his own council since Byzantium was in no capacity capable of challenging him and his empire. The counsel overturned the decision of Nicea in which iconoclast were deemed heretics and with that effectively started the schism which would come to full effect and split in 1054. Also paving the way for the beelden storm and the reformation."

 hie_frn_frankfurter_messe_desc: "Also known as The Frankfurt trade fair. The fair was not only the biggest of its kind west of the Rhine but the biggest of the empire. It was a permanent trading complex that sold everything. And it enjoyed imperial protection which meant nobody could be robbed, hurt or attacked, less they would be put to justice by the emperor himself. From the 15th century onward the Messe would become famous for its many varieties of books they sold and would become one of the many centers for discussion both religious and educational."

Then in 1562 with the decline of Aachen we would be given the title of imperial capital the electorate moved here and the coronations of the emperor moved here too. This means that no one would take the risk of attacking us any longer, no one would dare to invoke the wrath of the entire empire against them. Not only the electorate moved here along with it came the Reichstag or imperial parliament. From now on all roads lead to frankfurt."
 hie_frn_frankfurt_exchange: "The Frankfurt Exchange"
 hie_frn_frankfurt_exchange_desc: "In 1585 frankfurt implemented a set exchange rate for all known existing currencies in europe. This was not only to help their ever growing number of foreign traders in the city. It was also mainly to prevent cheating and extortion on prices by offering less or more value for a product depending on what currency you paid with. This had become a quite popular practice for example by charging more for people who had currencies from outside of the empire."

This system first utilized in the empire was used by the imperial administration to govern its empire in the name of the emperor. It was a system that ran parallel with the local governments. The local Bavarian government collected taxes and applied the Bavarian law. This system under the empire would work in a perfect world in unison with the local governments and make sure imperial law was properly observed and followed. In effect creating a second government that helped the local government in efficiency and effectiveness."
 hie_ger_divided_faith_united_purpose: "Divided in Faith, United in Purpose"
 hie_ger_divided_faith_united_purpose_desc: "Perhaps partly due to the highly decentralized politics of the region, Swabia saw more religious diversity during the Reformation than any other part of the empire. Protestants, Catholics, and Reformed jostled for converts here; but, unlike other regions, we largely avoided religious conflicts between the faiths, realizing that such a conflict could only do more harm than good. That we have learned to live and prosper together will be a strength even after the fractured city-states are long gone."

They are the backbone of the survival and the continuation of our Saxon heritage. We protect this with great fervor and this defense of our ideals grants us a reputation for standing up for ourselves and our morals."
 hie_ger_stechschritt: "Der Stechschritt"
 hie_ger_stechschritt_desc: "The "Stechschritt" originated in the 18th century, like other march steps, as a method of keeping troops lined up properly as they advanced towards enemy lines. It was introduced into German military tradition by Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. The goose step is a difficult marching style that takes much practice and coordination. It is therefore reserved for ceremonial occasions such as military parades. Because it is difficult to maintain for long periods of time, troops typically only begin to goose-step when they approach the reviewing stand and return to a normal march step once they have marched past. Large military parades require several days of practice to ensure that troops can perform the goose step without injuring themselves. Preparatory training includes having soldiers march in small groups, with arms linked to maintaining balance.\n\nIn the most rigorous form of the goose step, often found in guard mounting ceremonies, the pace is done at a slow march, and the leg is nearly horizontal, and sometimes well beyond. In a standard goose step, found in large military parades, the pace is done at a quick march and the leg is raised only to knee-height, or even to calf height. The lower goose step improves balance and unit cohesion at the tempo of a quick march. Flagbearers and honor guards will frequently march with a higher goose step than the mass of troops following."
 hie_ger_standesherren: "Standesherren"
 hie_ger_standesherren_desc: "In a Europe that is ever more increasing its centralization and is ever more reliant on absolutism especially within the empire with bigger and bigger states drawing more and more power to them. In this climate, a new social class appears. The general aristocracy and feudalism are a dying breed. But, they still hold quite a bit of wealth and especially local power. To be able to continue this trend of centralization, however, we need to get rid of these local feudal seats. Here is where standesherren are born, this is the local aristocracy who are relieved of their feudal duties but retain their titles and private estates. They also retain private rights to any and all natural resources on those private estates. This makes it so that we have direct control over taxation and conscription in those former feudal lands while the former local feudal lords are still able to keep their estates in order and utilize the resources to survive. This would in effect create the first private companies and ventures completely independent from their state. Things like mining companies, fisheries, or the fur industry would take their first baby steps under private control. This would shape Europe's modern aristocracy from feudal lords into businessmen and women."
 hie_ger_wartburgfest: "Wartburgfest"
 hie_ger_wartburgfest_desc: "This was a manifestation of students, intellectuals and nationalist of the idea of a German nation. After the congress of Vienna and the reestablishment of the old order these groups were left disappointed. The congress of vienna basically put a major delay on what was to be the unification of a german state for german people. So students from Jena announced in 1817 they would organize a national manifestation on the 18th of october for like minded people and german nationalists. This date was not chosen arbitrarily however it is no accident that it would coincide with the remembrance of Luther nailing his 95 objections and the battle and victory ad leipzig against Napoleon. It was a day earmarked by German pride and national unity. The call would be heard by about 500 German students which at that time would make up an 8th of the German student population. These 500 would erect the first national student association. who would go on to promote all over the German sphere ideas of liberalism, national freedom and unity for all germans."
 hie_ger_zollverein: "Zollverein"
 hie_ger_zollverein_desc: "This is effectively an economic industrial and trade coalition of the German states that would make it easier to do all those things across the borders of their nations. This was born out of the fracturing of Germany and the restoration of the old order with the congress of vienna. Both north and south erected a zollverein of themselves. This pact of states would basically ensure the continuation of the industrial process, the free movement of goods and their protection among the states in the pact and their transport of goods and people. This would not only lay the foundations of the German internal economy after unification but would serve as the foundation of the Schengen zone implemented by the European Union in the later half of the 20th century."

As opposed to the flags of Prussia, Austria, or even the Hansa, our flag symbolizes the national unity of the disparate German people, and the willingness to fight for a democratic future. Out of the blackness of servitude through bloody battles into the golden light of freedom we have come, and we will never again be under bondage!"
 hie_ger_national_assembly: "National Assembly"
 hie_ger_national_assembly_desc: "The first order of business now that we have overthrown feudal tyranny is to set up a new governing body for ourselves. In Frankfurt, long a central city to the empire and a strategic location, we shall do exactly that. Unlike the French and their petty mob squabbles, this Assembly shall be governed by a constitution, give representation to all Germanic peoples not just those in the capital city, and provide a rational forum for the advancement of Germania as a modern state."
 hie_ger_unification_of_germania: "Unification of Germania"
 hie_ger_unification_of_germania_desc: "Unlike most revolutionary movements, the Revolution of the German people had in mind an additional goal: the unification of those with a common heritage. For over a thousand years the Germans, although united by common cultural heritage, language, and laws, have been divided and weakened by a feudal order designed to make our servitude more effective and keep us weak. No more! No longer shall we simply look on as foreign armies fight over our ancient soil; these are our wars, and it is our time to stake our claim as a nation; what wars we fight to unite our own people are our own business, and no one else's."
 hie_ger_bundesrepublik: "Bundesrepublik"
 hie_ger_bundesrepublik_desc: "While we have left the old imperial shell behind, the German people are not blind to the unique strengths and weaknesses of their old unique empire. While too much decentralization makes a country weak, the balancing power of federalism allows us to effectively rule a large and wealthy population while also maintaining national unity and strength. By working a uniquely German federal system into our republic, we can create the best of both worlds. This especially matters in the realm of economics: while the nation as a whole conducts diplomatic and military affairs, economic matters are best suited to the local governments. This tailoring to regional interests makes our economy much more productive in the long run."
 hie_ger_pressefreiheit_und_fressefreiheit: "Pressefreiheit und Fressefreiheit"
 hie_ger_pressefreiheit_und_fressefreiheit_desc: "Freedom to read, and freedom to feed. These are two of the basic rights demanded by the revolution, and they encapsulate well the various class interests involved. The middle class, fueled by liberal ideals and the love of freedom, demands a free press and the rights to assembly and free speech. Meanwhile, the proletariat class demands the state enshrine their right to eat and provide food for the common man. Combining these interests and satisfying all demands may be challenging, but it shall bring our people together in support of our glorious nation."
 hie_ger_people_army: "The People's Army"
 hie_ger_people_army_desc: "The initial revolutions in Germany were largely instigated by middle-class liberals, who sought to create their new republic by peaceful means. However, they were paralleled by a new wave of worker and peasant uprisings attempting to secure their liberty by force. When reactionary forces inevitably marched on us to overthrow all of us together, we had no choice but to band together. Only by working together and fighting the enemy on their own terms saved our revolution, and we must continue to maintain our success by force of arms."

One of the first acts of the new nation must be to commission a German fleet to contest our neighbors.

Multiple tiers of the council govern each aspect of life and ensure each class has the ability to be represented. Most importantly, however, it facilitates the bourgeoisie classes by representing their interests and putting particular emphasis on managing and promoting trade."
 hie_gnv_assembly_halberds: "Assembly of the Halberds"
 hie_gnv_assembly_halberds_desc: "When negotiating with either overlords, fellow cantons, or even emperors and popes, Genevans know that armed protection of rights is the only protection of rights. This was symbolized when in 1525, the subjugation of Geneva to Savoy was agreed upon by the Council representatives only after the armed ones had been removed from the city; the remainder had to be compelled at spearpoint to give up their freedoms. Yet the people would not be swayed and took up Halberds themselves; the Genevan people will never succumb to tyranny without a fight."
 hie_gnv_protestant_rome: "Protestant Rome"
 hie_gnv_protestant_rome_desc: "While Geneva converted to Lutheran Protestantism initially in 1536, it would be with Calvin that its religious identity on the world stage was established. Calvin, with the help of the council and the citizens eager to show their newfound devotion, set about establishing Geneva to be a model city. It would serve simultaneously as a Zion for refuge to persecuted Reformed Christians, but also as a center for training and sending out missionaries and pastors. This successful initiative would make Geneva known as the Protestant Rome."
 hie_gnv_genevan_psalter: "Genevan Psalter"
 hie_gnv_genevan_psalter_desc: "The Reformers of Geneva recognized that worshiping the Lord with song was not only pleasing to the ear but effective to the heart; as Socrates is supposed to have said, music goes directly to the soul. Combining the goals of reforming worship practices and spreading their message, the Psalter was penned and produced, becoming the standard of new church music throughout Western Europe."
 hie_gnv_wathmaking_city: "The Watchmaking City"
 hie_gnv_wathmaking_city_desc: "The establishment of Geneva as a Protestant refuge started a trend of skilled artisans migrating to Geneva. Most notably, however, jewelers arrived who, finding that Calvin's austere Protestantism banned jewelry, pivoted to making decorative watches. Not only were watches set with gold and precious stones, but the work ethic inspired by Calvin's teachings created an extra demand for and focus on quality mechanical workings. Geneva watches would go on to become synonymous with luxury and high-quality timekeeping."
 hie_gnv_early_welfare_system: "Early Welfare System"
 hie_gnv_early_welfare_system_desc: "As part of the city's 16th-century reforms, a set of institutions were put in place for the caring of the poor. While private charities or churches had taken care of the poor and crippled in times past, Geneva was one of the first in the world to operate state-run organizations dedicated to providing for the lowest of society. This included the providing of free healthcare, allowing for many who would otherwise be prevented from work or military service by poor health and an ability to afford treatment to recover. This model would quickly spread throughout the Western world, but it started here."
 hie_gnv_citoyens_geneve: "Citoyens de Geneve"
 hie_gnv_citoyens_geneve_desc: "The Republic of Geneva was divided into four classes: the Citoyens, sons of citizens and bourgeoisie; bourgeoisie, sons of foreigners who bought residence in Geneva or were sons of the bourgeoisie themselves; Habitants, foreigners who bought residence in Geneva; and, natifs, who were the sons of foreigners who happened to be born in the city without having bought residential status. The upper tiers had more impactful political power and were able to hold offices; this not only made the merchant class loyal to the Republic but made citizenship a lucrative source of revenue for the state."

 hie_ham_old_new_hamburg_desc: "The original Hammaburg was founded in 825 on the northern bank of the Elbe river to protect the eastern frankish realm from invasion of both the Slavs and  the Danes respectively. Rather quickly however the small chapel within the castle would become the seat of the newly appointed Archbishop of Saxony and Northern Germany and Pomerania. This would all take place around 834 after the tiny castle at Hamburg no longer seemed suitable for an archbishop. The seat was moved to Bremen in 848 it changed the name to the archbishopric of Bremen-Hamburg. It was effectively put in charche to christianize the slavs and scandinavians; it did so with varying success in its 300 year function. Then in 1158 the duke of Holstein after the loss of Lübeck searched for a new trading port and found Hamburg to be ideal, founding the market town of Neu Hamburg next to Altstadt Hamburg which was a small city that had formed around the old Hammaburg. This created the city of Hamburg as we know it today which would prove a key trading point in not only north sea trade but also Baltic trade. Due to this the city grew rather rapidly and impressively and would be granted exclusive shipping and trading rights by the emperor in 1189."
 hie_ham_sister_city_lubeck: "The sister city of Lübeck"
 hie_ham_sister_city_lubeck_desc: "Like the city Hamburg the city Lübeck was also founded by the duke of Holstein only it was founded before Hamburg city however in 1143. This city was  lost to Henry “the lion” von Welf in 1158. The relationship between Hamburg and Lübeck as sister cities remained and they always stood by one another and shared ideas and ideals. This and the fact they both were very influential Hanseatic cities meant that they were very attractive to live in. We have become one of the beacons in the north. A safe and lucrative place for not only traders but craftsmen clerks and people of all walks of life."
 hie_ham_territoriale_politik: "Territoriale Politik"
 hie_ham_territoriale_politik_desc: "In theory every form in which you expand your realm could be called territorial politics. But the city of hamburg did this in a very peculiar way that was not completely unique but one of its only kind to do it in this fashion. They would effectively buy up towns, castles and land from neighboring dukes or land owners that needed money and would gradually integrate these under the central control of the city of hamburg. By the 15 century Hamburg had control over give or take some 30 towns and holdings that were dejure part of other duchies and counties but were sold to them. Which would make the city of Hamburg in technical terms the first modern real estate agency in europe."

Everyone along oure trade routes who have wronged us. We deem a robber and prosecute them. From the highest noble to the low lifes it does not matter do wrong to us and we will deem you an outlaw and do whatever it takes to have you stand trial in Hamburg. For example after a tax imposed on our traders in 1433 in the city of emden which is located in east friesland. We took over the city deemed its Mayor and the city council outlaws by robbing the people of our realm they were found guilty and the city became forfeit and compensation for their crimes."
 hie_ham_secularisation: "Secularisation"
 hie_ham_secularisation_desc: "After the reformation was legalized within the city and the realm we adopted secularization. All church lands were seized and sold to the highest bidder. Which would become a common thing when acquiring new land or towns. It also marked the beginning of great reforms no longer where we bound to listen to the clergy without their land; they have no power anymore. Things like tax and land reforms which the clergy have always opposed are now possible."
 hie_ham_citadel_hamburg: "The citadel that is Hamburg"
 hie_ham_citadel_hamburg_desc: "In 1616 we hired the Dutch fortification expert Jan van Valckenborgh to build a new modern wall around the city but we wanted more than a wall we wanted Hamburg to be untakable. So one of the most impressive fortification efforts in northern germany began. The construction lasted 12 years and ended in 1628 but it was like nothing the region had ever seen. A wall to match the importance of the city. It saved us from falling during the 30 year war and the city would never be effectively sieged."
 hie_ham_ambivalente_position_stadt_hamburg: "Ambivalente Position der Stadt Hamburg"
 hie_ham_ambivalente_position_stadt_hamburg_desc: "Until the 27th of may 1768 Hamburg was not a free city. They were technically a city loyal to the duke of Holstein but Hamburg played its cards right. It had already achieved semi independence from the duke since it was granted both its imperial trade privileges and its imperial right to police and prosecute in its own realm. However they maintained the position of being a Holsteiner city and not a free city because that would not only require imperial recognition which they didn't have but would also limit them in their actions legally. For example it would mean they could no longer purchase new lands or sell them. It would also mean they could no longer confiscate church land since they fell under the empire's direct control if they were to become a free city. They achieved this position due to the fact that in 1439 the Danish crown gained a union with Holstein but due to their practical independence they weren't included in the union. Of course to the great pleasure of the imperial crown Hamburg remained in the empire. The city council would convince the emperor to keep them a Holsteiner city instead of declaring a free one to maintain the empire's claim over Holstein. So it was that Hamburg came to enjoy all the privileges that came with being a free city without the bureaucratic red tape and legal restrictions of one. Making it effectively the only true republic of the empire. What changed in 1768 however is that the title of Holstein was effectively abandoned by the emperors. So the diplomatic justification for Hamburg ambivalence was no longer needed; the empire was in decline and the emperor needed money. This would lead to the decision to make Hamburg a free city putting it under the direct control and leadership of the emperor."

However, our state of Hanover is a revival and a reclamation of this old duchy. Our title of the electorate of Saxony has since been stolen by the house von Wettin in what they call the duchy “Saxony” which has no claim to any original Saxon land or its people. We on the other hand rule over the ancient Saxon lands so the Saxon electorate is clearly ours by birthright."

We may not have invented this practice however we utilize it with great efficiency. Due to the fact we are legally indivisible we get all the bonuses without all the drawbacks like the disintegration of the realm. Using this practice we give an ally to the house and state a piece of land effectively making them a prince of Hannover. These princes would be used to uphold local order and law but more importantly, to keep the peace within the realm. This would also strengthen our diplomatic institutions. These princes do not only aid with our international relations but also our local relations."

Usually, these things are the authority and domain of the prince or elector themselves. We deemed this to take too much time away from ruling the realm. So we've decided to appoint a council, this streamlined and greatly increased the prince-elector's control over the imperial estates. For the council answers only to the elector."
 hie_han_privy_council_hannover: "Privy Council of Hannover"
 hie_han_privy_council_hannover_desc: "The concept of a Real union is having a vassal that can function outside the feudal concept. Under normal circumstances, a vassal is a ruler or a state loyal to the crown of a greater realm. A Real union bypasses this by making the vassal not loyal to any crown but by making them loyal to a state or country. So this bypasses the feudal system in that it is no longer required to have any form of monarchy or aristocracy to link the state or title to the greater crown. It in effect creates a state within a state with no loyalty bar to the modern state, not the monarch."

After the Thuringian succession war, we gained our independence. This war started the militarization of our realm and the reforms stemming from this conflict characterized us as a people and a duchy."

And would solidify our name in the protestant world."

A leibregiment is a regiment with loyalty specifically to their ruler and only their ruler or state. This is why they aren't mercenaries like the Swiss but auxiliaries. The dukes of Hesse would rent their leibregiments for the price of upkeep and pay for the soldiers to his allies and not to the best bidder like mercenaries tended to do. The reason the hessian soldier regiments were so popular among protestants is that they were known for fighting without fear and with extreme bravery. It is not money or riches that drives them, it is fighting for what they believe is right that drives them."

This however benefits us greatly and puts us at the forefront of the scientific revolution."

He was one of the first if not possibly the first protestant ruler in Europe. The man was famous for his military prowess, the way he treated enemies almost like friends, and how he was always merciful. He would produce THE example of what it means to be a protestant ruler. And the protestant church would henceforth use this title in the German world to give to protestant rulers who have embodied the ideals of the church. To be a wise, educated, and merciful man that is a firm believer and is true to his people. He would also be henceforth the example that Hessians but especially Hessian rulers would try to live up to."

In this climate, a new social class appears. The general aristocracy and feudalism are a dying breed. But, they still hold quite a bit of wealth and especially local power. To be able to continue this trend of centralization, however, we need to get rid of these local feudal seats. Here is where standesherren are born, this is the local aristocracy who are relieved of their feudal duties but retain their titles and private estates. They also retain private rights to any and all natural resources on those private estates. This makes it so that we have direct control over taxation and conscription in those former feudal lands while the former local feudal lords are still able to keep their estates in order and utilize the resources to survive. This would in effect create the first private companies and ventures completely independent from their state. Things like mining companies, fisheries, or the fur industry would take their first baby steps under private control. This would shape Europe's modern aristocracy from feudal lords into businessmen and women."

Technically the emperor could do as he pleased with the money in the Reichsgut but first and foremost it was meant to pay for the imperial palaces and the empire's administration. However, the Reichsgut would during the later Hohenstaufen dynasty fall out of the emperor's hands and be gifted to the most powerful elector. This would lead to incredible abuse of the funds leaving the imperial palaces as abandoned ruins and the administration unfunded and basically obsolete. Instead, the money would be used b the elector in charge to fund his wars and personal vices. This now has come to an end with our elimination of the electorate. We've now regained control over the Reichsgut and use it for its intended use. To fund the public building and administration of the empire. And maybe spruce up our own palaces a little too."

The Groschen was not only the standard coin within the empire but also in the low countries, the Balkans, Hungary, and the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth. There were universal laws for minting them and they were heavily enforced within the empire. However, a lot of kings minted their own coins which meant there were many variations in circulation. Now with much of Europe under our control even more so than most puts us in an indirect authority to create a European currency. Effectively creating a single European market backed by one currency is something that has not been achieved since the days of Rome itself. This will not only bring economic security and stability to Europe but make it a true economic superpower on the world stage. Creating a rival for the Arabian, Indian, and Chinese currencies and markets."

They would draw inspiration from Rome itself but also from the Merovingians and the Carolingians' governments and administrations. They would be the first to play with the idea of a totally unified Europa. Their ideas were incredibly unpopular during their rule in the post-Hohenstaufen Holy Roman Empire. Under the Hohenstaufens local lords, dukes and kings came to enjoy greater and greater autonomy and wealth and house Luxembourg tried to revert this and was met with great resistance every step of the way. They would eventually lose their Imperial title and their house would die out. But here their ideas were never forgotten in fact the Bohemian crown has ever since strived for imperial centralization and Unity. Now that we've made the dream of house Luxembourg of a centralized imperium a reality, there is but one goal left: a united Europa."

By the end of the 15th century, the Burgundian block might have actually been the most powerful with their firm and direct grip on the prosperous low countries, their political grip over the rhine land, and their influence in southern Burgundy of old regarding rohmadia Provençe and Savoy. With technical imperial claims to all of western Francia. They were a diplomatic entity to fear with the geran block being in a state of division like no other. The Italian block is politically divided between the pope and the empire. And the Bohemian block was virtually destroyed after the effects of the battle of Varna.

On that occasion an army of about 42 800 men was gathered, of which 24 700 knights (of which 2 700 men-at-arms and 22 000 of other types) divided into 140 squads and 18 000 infantrymen (3 780 heavy infantry called 'comrades' and 12 600 infantry called 'pay') divided into two armies.

The recognition of the title of Duke by Emperor Sigismund in 1416 certifies the growing influence of the former Savoyard county and his leadership, who can now actively devote himself to domestic politics. And so Amedeo devoted himself to drafting the first body of general laws promulgated by the House of Savoy: the Sabaudiæ Statutes, also known as General Statutes, were born, and preserved in the Turin State Archives.

Clearly, the German pretenders were unfit to rule as the heirs of Rome.

Even after all this time that decision still influences the region Aachen has remained the imperial capital which makes it very attractive for traders and artists. They often remain in the region as well. One could say all roads lead to Limbourg."

 hie_kle_wachter_klever_reichswald_desc: "One of our titles given to us by the emperor is the guardians of the imperial parks and woods of Cleve. These once were the lands linked to the imperial palace at Aachen but since it was declared an imperial free city these lands came under our jurisdiction. In real terms this tile means nothing but it at least carries some weight in the empire and gives a boost to how we are perceived as a dynasty."
 hie_kle_via_media: "Via Media"
 hie_kle_via_media_desc: "A term used to describe the rule of John the “peaceful” in which he described his stance on the reformation. Meaning that he considered himself a catholic but highly sympathetic to the points made by the Reformation. This would make him extremely popular with tolerant reformists and Catholics which on both sides was harder to find than you think. Later popes would use him as an example of what it meant to be a post-trent catholic. This vision however would mean he was very diplomatically connected on both sides of the reformation. Marrying one of his daughters to the von Wettin elector of Saxony and another to the staunchly catholic von Wittelsbachs of Bavaria and the Palatinate. One of the major drivers behind this “Via Media” was the presence of Erasmus at his court who fed into John's interest in the humanities. This would make his court one of the main centers in the Holy Roman Empire where these ideas of the reformation and humanities could be openly discussed and where the discussion of them was openly encouraged. This trend would from then on always be present in both the Catholic and Protestant sides of the family and would be a great source of pride."

We've never been in a position to make use of this but now that we have gained some power and find ourselves in a somewhat dominant position for the first time in history. We might be able to take control. There have been plans to build river castles and via this police and toll this transition from Germany to the low countries and “vice versa”. Now we can put those plans to work and control the local trade while at the same time paying for our new fortifications."

 hie_kol_imperial_concessions_desc: "A variety of factors converge to make our glorious city-state incredibly strategic for major powers. Situated in the middle of the Rhenish trade, along with our position as an elector, productive lands, a well-defended citadel, a strategic route between Germany and France, and having one of the holiest sites in Catholicism, we have always had a strong bargaining position. Whether its guarantees of our freedoms by the emperor, obtaining beneficial trade agreements from the Hansa, or striking deals internally between bishop and city, Cologne has a special ability to gain favors from allies and neutral parties alike."
 hie_kol_erblandesvereinigung: "Erblandesvereinigung"
 hie_kol_erblandesvereinigung_desc: "Literally translated as Hereditary Land Associations, these were organizations of the various estates unique to Colognian society. Starting in 1463, the agreements they negotiated with the state became the foundation for the electorate's laws and a guarantee of rights to each class. Especially, the estates were given participation in governance, especially concerning the levying of taxes and the conduct of war."
 hie_kol_free_city_cologne: "Free City of Cologne"
 hie_kol_free_city_cologne_desc: "By 1400, Cologne was the largest city in the Holy Roman Empire and one of the richest. A series of standoffs and revolts then occurred between the increasingly influential citizenry and the bishop of Cologne, who sought to maintain his power. Finally, in 1475, a compromise was reached: the Emperor declared the city of Cologne itself a Free Imperial City. At the same time, the bishop, although banned from entering the city itself except for religious occasions, still maintained nominal control of the city and held sway outside its walls; this gives us the benefits of urban development that being a free city provides while still maintaining our influence as an elector."

 hie_kol_gaffeln_desc: "An organization made of the 22 “gaffs,” or professional clubs. Every adult male citizen had to belong to one of the Gaffeln, and together they elected a council of 49 members. This governance by the workers, merchants, and professionals created a beneficial regulatory environment, with regulations tailor-made to the economic needs of the city and tight control over sanitation, vagrancy, and other economic ills. This system of government would last from the late 14th century all the way up until the Napoleonic Wars."
 hie_kol_papal_nunciature: "Papal Nunciature"

Three of these papal delegates would eventually become Popes in their own right: Urban VII, Alexander VII, and Leo XII. Established to increase papal presence, these posts were designed to hearten Catholics in their struggle against the growth of heresy and to fend off the Reformation however possible through writings, curtailing clerical corruption, and force when necessary. Cologne became a center of Counter-Reformation, with the Papal emissaries doing their best to bring as many in northern Germany back into the fold as possible."
 hie_kol_flexible_diplomacy: "Flexible Diplomacy"
 hie_kol_flexible_diplomacy_desc: "While remaining a staunchly Catholic holdout in a sea of Protestantism in North Germany, Cologne was not blind to the realities of diplomacy and politics. Even before the Reformation, their position as electors required them to switch allegiances often and smooth out the diplomatic fallout afterward. During the religious wars, this skill came into good use; by allying various factions at various times and buying off the rest, they ensured that the conflict that saw half of Germany butchered left our precious city untouched."

This system of checks and balances, and its resulting separation of church and state, put Cologne ahead of its time in terms of governance."

This means that all the people bound to the allodial land pay taxes and are direct levies of the person who owns the land. Not who is the de jure ruler of the land. This kind of land was amongst the most coveted in the European inheritance game. Because you don't pay any taxes or have to give levies to your feudal lord since the allodial land is your land and not anyone else's."

 hie_lpp_city_builders_desc: "The founding of our county was in a rather under populated area of the empire. Our leaders have done their best to change that and we boast a great number of cities now. Not particularly large ones but cities non the less. Our counts would invite people to move from within the exciting cities and over time more and more immigrants would arrive due to the fact we were such a forgotten place rarely any conflict happened here so it was an attractive place to settle for the freeman of lower saxony."
 hie_lpp_samtherrschaft: "Samtherrschaft"
 hie_lpp_samtherrschaft_desc: "Our county is very much so on the lower end of the political spectrum within the Holy Roman Empire. Due to the way feudalism works our state has exclaves and enclaves all over the place but so have other states. To create a somewhat governable society we have come to an agreement among the independent counties to form a joined government of sorts or a Samtherrschaft. We police the roads jointly and enforce a joint code of law, this has not only reinforced the relationship but has also given us a strong sense of community. Another thing is that we have become a serious political entity. Alone we really could do much but as a unity of counts we have a bit of regional influence."
 hie_lpp_pactum_unionis: "Pactum unionis"
 hie_lpp_pactum_unionis_desc: "Or the pact of unity was an agreement between the count of lippe and its many cities, mainly its largest. These cities had since become major regional trade hubs due to traffic from westphalian and saxony repeatedly crossing in the region and the main road between champagne and hamburg ran through lippe. These cities had come to wield quite a bit of economic and political power. And first they would act rebellious towards the count. Over time however it became clear to these cities that this decentralization of what already is a small realm in between bigger realms would spell nothing but war and division for them. Where in some places cities lost their rights after being conquered. So in one of the rare cases of common sense in the period they actually formed an agreement with the count and in turn they would add to their city rights and laws that from now and to the end they are cittie of lippen and only lippen. For in unity we find our power."

For us its main importance is the start with our scholaric fascination with the stars and the school of fysica. This book somewhat kickstarted a very scholarly court culture based on the collection and criticism of scientific works within the school of fysica. Thus we have since ad the court of lippe established a library specifically dedicated to the subject and invite masters in it to reside in our wing especially designed to house them and allow them to do their research outside of the confines of a university. You ask why they would do this well. Our budget is not divided among many subjects and our counts personally fund their endeavors."

We are one of the few if not the only ones in old saxony that have chosen for the reformed church. And it is in fact quite popular and entrenched here. We have beaten all resistance with debate, instructions and admissions. Our reformed priests are among the most skilled orators and have a deep understanding of the bible and the faith. To a point our priests have started to work out their influence in major hubs of the reformation at large. Places like the new duchy of saxony, the palatinate and hesse have seen great influx in reformed converts and discussion thanks to our speakers. We have become, if just a small one, a center of reformation."

Within the shelter of the Holy Roman Empire, nowhere is it more firmly entrenched than in Mainz. While the moral quality of our simony is questionable at best, it brings in much-needed cash from the rest of the empire. This can, of course, be cash up front or special indulgences to fund the loans needed for such a price. This has made our particular bishopric's practices notorious for both simony and aggressive indulgence sales throughout the empire. What could possibly go wrong?"

And work by interweaving walls into one another. Which would also make them hard to take even with cannons. They also employed the Roman technique of filling up the negative space in the walls with sand or gravel making the walls harder to breach with siege equipment. They employed massive garrisons yet somehow managed to maintain them all."

 hie_mva_saint_rastislav_desc: "Rastislav was the nephew of the founder of the Mojmirid dynasty Mojmir I. He came to power after his uncle was deposed by Louis the German. His uncle was overthrown because he maintained the heathen Slavic faith, unlike his nephew Rastislav. Rastislave would first reach out to Rome for missionaries and monks to help convert and Christianize his realm. The pope however would turn him down. Rastislav then reached out to Constantinople where he was received with open arms. Constantinople was more than happy to send monks, priests, and missionaries. This however came under the condition of an alliance against the Bulgarian Empire. After this Rastislav would turn on the Franks that gave him his crown and he would repel a number of Frankish attempts to retake Moravia. He would then also manage to defeat the Bulgarians a number of times taking control over the Duchy of Pannonia. After his death, the patriarch of Constantinople would declare him a saint for his efforts to Christianize the western Slavs and for his struggles against his enemies."

 hie_mva_colloquium_generale_desc: "Also known as the Moravian diet or curia generalis. Was the effective legislature of Moravia. This consisted of the upper nobility, knights, the bishop of Olomouc, the abbots, and ambassadors of the cities. The diet's initial task consisted of keeping the peace between the estates. This however gradually evolved into an effective government that controlled the day-to-day in Moravia. They did however have no say in taxation laws or conscription but they would enforce the law, streamline the government and aid the Margrave in running the government. This would give the estates a more central place in the ruling body than most Medieval regimes."

Over the past 5 centuries, the Magyars turned into the Hungarians but we've remembered our downfall and we have learned. Our infantry is now equipped as anti-cavalry troops creating effectively a human tank. To complement this new soldier we have developed the half-moon formation. This formation consists of our infantry when spotting a charge forming up in a formation that creates a sickle or a half moon. This creates a trap for the charging cavalry, horse archers, and lancers alike. In a cavalry attack, they mainly focus on the body of the unit by the time they are charging it's already too late and the formation closes in on them effectively surrounding the cavalry."

Our western and Northern brothers are still under the thumb of the Germans. Our southern brothers are being exploited by the Hungarians.

So profitable is trade along this mighty artery, in fact, that countless small states with expensive and lavish courts can each take a cut from it, and still everyone profits. In addition, this common trade network gave rise to a common currency zone. The Rhenish guilder was one of the first standardized coinage of the empire and was widely recognized for its stability fueled by the consistent and profitable Rhine trade. Needless to say, the ability to toll the river was one highly coveted by all who could strive for it, and many who couldn't. It is our responsibility to make the best use we can of it."

Lower Lorraine eventually became what was known as the Low Countries and would eventually unify into their own political entities. The realms of Upper Lorraine, however, were able to maintain their autonomy and freedoms for centuries, and by the 16th century made up two of the imperial circles.

Yet, here in the Rhineland, Benedictine monks have produced high-quality wine for centuries, taking advantage of the rich soil and mild climate to do so. The result is a lucrative luxury product, but one which provides benefits to our own people as well since its price is not unduly inflated by snooty marketing like that of a certain uppity French duchy we could name."
 hie_nsa_romanticism: "Romanticism"
 hie_nsa_romanticism_desc: "By the 18th century, with the cold rationalism of the Enlightenment holding sway over much of Europe, paired with the cold exploitation of the Industrial Revolution, German thinkers, and artists paved the way for a counter-cultural movement known as Romanticism. The Rhineland was a major center of Romantic thought, music, plays, and art, which sought to restore an appreciation for emotions, beauty, individualism, folk culture, and heroism; essentially, it sought to rehumanize what the Enlightenment had made purely abstract. Ravaged by the wars and revolutions of the 18th century, the Rhineland proved fertile ground for this movement, leading to vast patronage of musicians such as Ludwig van Beethoven and writers like von Goethe."

This is a Official of the imperial government who administrates lands on the behalf of the empire. Due to the political climate of the interregnum never being resolved the Reichsschultheiß stayed in permanent control of the former capital of the Burgraviate. He would in time slowly be integrated into the city council and after the city was declared an imperial free city. The imperial mayor or syndic of the city would carry the title of Reichsschultheiß. Which would be found nowhere else in the empire for this situation had never happened before nor did it ever happen again."
 hie_num_unofficial_capital: "The unofficial capital"
 hie_num_unofficial_capital_desc: "Due to the many diets held in Nuremberg, especially those concerning the imperial legal code, administration and those regarding electors, we were deemed the unofficial capital of the empire. A more correct term would have been the administrative capital of the empire or the bureaucratic capital of the empire. After the Golden Imperial Bull in 1356 it was deemed a legal requirement that each emperor's first diet would be held in Nuremberg. An emperor's first diet usually consisted of going over the current imperial legal codes, monetary reforms, taxes, trade and political directions or goals. Hence why bureaucratic capital would be far more fitting."

Important to mention here is that we have one of the most extensive sets of city rights. Not even Aachen the imperial capital carries so many rights. This bit of context should explain why it is of such a great deal of importance to us. We were not only given the right of our own taxation laws and freedoms. We were also granted the right to mint, the imperial right to toll trade. And the imperial right to conduct our own trade laws like customs policy of trade taxation. All independent of any dejure lord including the emperor himself. We have complete legal autonomy.

The city council which mainly consisted of a collection of the city's most influential patricians burgers and aristocrats which were the city's main body of executive power. Then you had the inner council which consisted of a set group of Ancient families, aristocrats or not that had been credited with one of the cities founding families. The members of these councils would act like the supreme rulers of the city but as a council. They would be the final authority and act like judges or a president ratifying laws and imposing the cities laws. This all changed when in 1370 it was decided that the city council should permanently reserve 8 seats for the artisan guild leaders and would be known as the council of eligibles. They would however be frowned upon by the members of the city council who saw them as lesser people who were uneducated and only knew how to work with their hands not how to make laws. Due to this alienation the artisan class of the city would slowly over time grow more and more discontent due to underrepresentation in the city leadership. This all came ahead during the Handwerkeraufstand or the craftsman revolt. The artisans would however lose this and the guilds would be disbanded and. This lack of leadership would be solved by the city putting a family in charge of controlling a certain trade within the city. This created a system of Oligarchy which survived until the absolvement of our free city states and our integration into the grand duchy of Bavaria."

These parties were extremely exclusive and invitation only organized by the city's ancient families of the inner circle. It had become a political competition to get into one of these parties because most of the German nobility usually wasn't included.

 hie_pal_imperial_vicars_desc: "Under the Golden Bull of 1356, which established the Holy Roman Empire as an elective monarchy, the Elector-Palatine and the Prince Elector of Saxony were entrusted with the Imperial Vicarship. This entrusted the two electors as “the administrators of the empire itself… receiving oaths of fealty for and in the name of the empire.” This reinforced the two electors' ancient role as stewards under Frankish law from the time of Charlemagne himself. \nIn practice, this meant that the respective regions assigned to the princes were administered by the princes whenever there was an interregnum between emperors. This grew less and less frequent as years passed and as House von Habsburg obtained a semi-permanent hold on the imperial throne. Despite this shift, however, we may yet be able to leverage our lawfully granted privileges as vicars to assert our own political authority in the region. Failing that, we could at least use it for diplomatic advantage or to improve our internal stability."

This makes us one of the highest representatives of the empire abroad, and also grants us a privileged position at home, as it is us who have to ratify every imperial election, and thus our monarchs are used to strengthening diplomatic ties within and outside of the empire."

While most rulers took this strictly, choosing a church and forcing all their subjects to stick with it, the Palatinate was different. Both in its educational institutions and in its palaces and courts, our rulers encourage debates and impassioned defenses of one's beliefs without fear of reprisal. While the state religion is chosen by the Elector, he is open to persuasion, and he expects others to be also. This would be most famously shown in the reign of Frederick III von Wittelsbach. While a devout Reformed man himself, he ensured all faiths had a home in his realm and himself gave an impassioned defense of his faith and policies in the Imperial diet, arguing that only God, not any man, even the Emperor himself, can judge a man's faith. Previous electors had even, albeit unsuccessfully, attempted to bring Protestants and Reformed together in unity in the halls of Heidelberg Castle."

Militarism was seen as a duty of the Junkers and the peasants, with military personnel held in higher regard than their contemporary counterparts. This was formalized in September 1743, when Frederick the Great held the first fall maneuver (Herbstübung), in which the different branches of the army tested new formations and tactics; the fall maneuvers become annual traditions of the Prussian Army."

 hie_pru_goosestep: "Der Stechschritt"
 hie_pru_goosestep_desc: "The "Stechschritt" originated in the 18th century, like other march steps, as a method of keeping troops lined up properly as they advanced towards enemy lines. It was introduced into German military tradition by Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. The goose step is a difficult marching style that takes much practice and coordination. It is therefore reserved for ceremonial occasions such as military parades. Because it is difficult to maintain for long periods of time, troops typically only begin to goose-step when they approach the reviewing stand and return to a normal march step once they have marched past. Large military parades require several days of practice to ensure that troops can perform the goose step without injuring themselves. Preparatory training includes having soldiers march in small groups, with arms linked to maintaining balance.\n\nIn the most rigorous form of the goose step, often found in guard mounting ceremonies, the pace is done at a slow march, and the leg is nearly horizontal, and sometimes well beyond. In a standard goose step, found in large military parades, the pace is done at a quick march and the leg is raised only to knee-height, or even to calf height. The lower goose step improves balance and unit cohesion at the tempo of a quick march. Flagbearers and honor guards will frequently march with a higher goose step than the mass of troops following."
 hie_pru_schooling_system: "Bildungsreform"
 hie_pru_schooling_system_desc: "Prussian education always had a military prerogative, but it also aimed to create a nation of academics and intellectuals that would further the nation. Frederick's Generallandschulreglement is seen as the basic foundation of the Bildungsreform. Prussia was among the first countries in the world to introduce tax-funded and generally compulsory primary education, consisting of an eight-year course of primary education, called Volksschule. It provided not only basic technical skills needed in a modernizing world but also music and religious education in close cooperation with the churches and tried to impose a strict ethos of duty, sobriety, and discipline. Mathematics and calculus were not compulsory at the start, and taking such courses required additional payment by parents. Frederick the Great also formalized further educational stages, the Realschule and as the highest stage the Gymnasium, which served as a university-preparatory school."

Over time this interest only grew and several Hohenstaufens had made Dux Rothenburg part of their rich number of titles. In 1239 it was officially decreed an imperial free city even though it had already effectively been one after the inheritance to the imperial crown in the early 11th century. It had become the imperial center of power and authority in Swabia having located in it the imperial administration for its swabian lands and lords."
 hie_rot_pre_planne_city: "Pre-planned city"
 hie_rot_pre_planne_city_desc: "From the oncet the imperial intent to make Rothenburg a Keizers Palts and imperial city was clear. Starting in the 12th century a pre planned city was being built near the Rothenburg from the Staufen dynasty clearly wanting an imposing seat in swabia, their home region. An impressive church linked with two imperial monasteries; one for the order of saint john, better known as the knights, and another for the teutonic order. The city already had a wall, even though a settlement of its size at that time usually didn't warrant one. It was a feat of city planning not seen since the Romans: in a short span of 12 years Rothenburg went from a village and a Castle to a fully built imperial city. This all ended however with the extinction of the Hohenstaufen imperial house and the line at large. After the election of the first Habsburg emperor Rothenburg became neglected by the imperial crown. It being the jewel of Swabia and its imperial authority and center."

Our burger class never had any military inclinations eiter they were mainly busy with politics and trade.so for us to grow we would need to get a little creative. We are located in somewhat of a very under-inhabited region mainly surrounded by estates and larger privately owned fortified farms. So we started to buy those or convince the owners to gift them to our city. In this way we've managed to grow our city and surrounding land to about 450 square kilometers. This has made quite a few people not only jealous, for example the bishop of würzburg who expected to gain most of this land in donations to the church."
 hie_rot_legal_ambiguity: "Legal ambiguity"

They petitioned the emperor to place an imperial ban on our city. And this worked not only didn't the von habsburgs not care about our position within the empire but our own emperor abandoned us. Due to this imperial ban the alliance of the bishop and the burgrave managed to conquer all our surrounding land but failed to ever take the city itself. Our walls and the Rothenburg held. We managed due to clever diplomatic maneuvering to rejoin the empire and force a peace. This peace came at the cost of our mayor however. He was placed under arrest by the bishop and would later die under suspicious circumstances.in this peace we also managed to regain more than half of our territory. This would however prompt us to look into our defense both diplomatically and militarily securing ourselves.via alliances and a new network of provincial defenses that went beyond our walls. A network of guard towers a new and wider moat with multi layered defenses around the city and small fortified outposts through the land."

The empire that respected its imperial centers and institutions had a just and leading clergy kept in tone by the emperor. But most of all it has proven that its habsburg emperors are just electoral puppets and dandies who would sell their mother for more imperial prestige. We are on our own; the emperors were just ready to toss us to the wolves at the complaint of 2 princes. This all has made us realize we need to defend ourselves at least our title still means something among the electors so we can find allies. But we can't really depend on others. From now on we will set aside a budget specifically for the maintenance and upgrading of our defensive network and forces."

We were almost naturally in joining the protestant church from the get go under the reformer Karlstadt but this was ended after the german peasant wars in which the catholic aristocracy won and enforced the catholic order on us. And many evangelists were killed in the city. But overtime and with the wars being in the past the city regained itself and reintroduced the lutheran church in the city with inviting Thomas Venatorius who slowly laid the groundwork. Then more and more reformers were invited over the next 10 years. And it has become clear that Rothenburg was to become the swabian center of the reformation. Culminating in with the founding of the first swabian protestant order."

We built a renaissance quarter which included things like theaters and schools for literature and the human sciences. A latin school and religious school was built. A great number of hospitals were built as well. It was truly a renovation of the city. Beyond that we gained notoriety for our plays and literature and the many writers who would touch any and all subjects debating all who would.

They started out by reforming the electorate and the bureaucracy of the empire. But what changed for us is that in the time we were under French occupation all the imperial administration was replaced by French administrations; the old duchies and borders were basically abolished. This creates a very strong power vacuum in the most western part of the empire like westphalia saxony and the rhineland.

On the other hand they had 3 acting dukes and at the same time being able to split a job among 3 people. This  meant that the responsibilities could be divided in three. This was a golden age for stability, centralisation and internal reform for the duchy.

 hie_slz_german_baroque_desc: "For many reasons, Salzburg is a natural entryway for new Italian trends and styles to come into Germany. Situated on a trade route through the Alps, with important salt and gold mines adding wealth to the area, it is no wonder that we have become a cultural hub. Yet, the wise investments of our own leaders cannot be underestimated either. Under our bishops, the city reinvented and rebuilt itself with the pristine and glorious architecture of the Italian Baroque style, introducing it to Germany and earning it the nickname “German Rome.”"
 hie_slz_magic_boy_trials: "Magic Boy Trials"
 hie_slz_magic_boy_trials_desc: "Long after much of the rest of Europe moved on from witch trials, we openly and proudly carry them on. Because of a wave of children being found guilty of witchcraft, especially boys, the latest round of trials became known as the magic boy trials. One of the aspects of our ruthless judicial efficiency was promising leniency if suspects would turn in other suspects. This worked wonders for us, with over a hundred witches being uncovered and summarily executed. The fact that this got rid of much of the problem of beggars in the city was merely a positive side effect."

 hie_sor_spreewald_und_grenzwall_desc: "Our terrain, however beautiful, can be very hostile towards those that haven't got any experience with it. The spreewald is a large inland delta and swamp populated by heavy forests. This terrain is extremely treacherous and unpredictable. Many armies have mistaken it for a lush green forest and have lost many a number from our knowledge of the terrain and how to abuse it in combat. Then there's also the Grenzwall which is a large ridge in the west of the duchy that forms a natural border between us and that of the Saxon electorate. Invading armies from the west either have to go over them and set duces over the small passes or go around them and open themselves up to combat in the plains."
 hie_sor_lusatian_textiles: "Lusatian textiles"
 hie_sor_lusatian_textiles_desc: "Lusatian wool is among the highest quality in the eastern empire, our sheep our pride of the nation. From their pristine wool we make excellent and warm clothing for the harsh winter climate. In fact our wool is so popular it is almost exclusively used in Saxony, Brandenburg and bohemia. It is high quality and is respected all over the eastern empire and in poland. It's durable and feels soft, ideal to make winter uniforms out of or just a nice set of winter clothes."
 hie_sor_protestant_refuge: "Protestant Refuge"
 hie_sor_protestant_refuge_desc: "While the empire is pulling itself apart in the name of religious freedom our duchy remained relatively neutral and untouched. This made it extremely attractive for protestants in the more conflict heavy regions like Bohemia propper Saxony and Westphalia. This has increased not only our population quite significantly but has left us to deal with it as the entire learning process has made us a more efficient state as well."
 hie_sor_estate_assembly: "Estate assembly"
 hie_sor_estate_assembly_desc: "The lusatian estate assembly was much like a parliament; it was a way for the duke to have total control over the estates. It was to remind them that the duke was not subject to them but they were in fact his subjects. Via this assembly he made the estates work for the duchy; it was their job after all. The ducal control over the estates made it so that there was a greater control over society at large."
 hie_sor_silver_mines: "Silver mines"
 hie_sor_silver_mines_desc: "The silvermines have always been the main backbone of our economy. Our silver was exclusively used to mint the bohemian coins. So our revenue did not lay in the silver itself but in the selling of the raw silver to mints within Bohemia and the Empire."
 hie_sor_lusatian_hussars: "Lusatian Hussars"
 hie_sor_lusatian_hussars_desc: "Our hussars are among the best in the empire. We've always been very adept in cavalry combat. But it wouldn't be until the development of hussars that the empire at large took notice that our hussars are not only the pride of the imperial army. Disgraced ones or ones who choose to be mercenaries are implemented into armies all over the German and Polish world."
 hie_sor_revival_sorbian_identity: "Revival of the Sorbian identity"
 hie_sor_revival_sorbian_identity_desc: "Lusatia used to be the heartland of a since dead culture due to the germanisation of our lands. The Sorbs were a slavic tribe and in some ways their culture is still alive but it is highly germanized. During the 17th century there would be a heavy push to revive this sorbian identity, the language which was previously pushed out of government and education became the new legal and educational language. Slowly but surely they would reject German culture as a whole."

 hie_sty_die_steiermark_desc: "The Steiermark wasn't always a given; it was created after the division of the Carantian march that was diplomatically annexed to the empire in the late 10th century under the Ottonian dynasty. It was given to the Otokar dynasty who moved their ducal capital to the town of Styre and hence Styria was born. Creating a new duchy out of a failing march. This turned the land from the border march into an integral duchy of the empire and hosted many great cities and baronies of the empire."
 hie_sty_lower_styria: "Lower Styria"
 hie_sty_lower_styria_desc: "Or Slovene Styria was added on to Styria in the 12th century and the capital was moved to Gräz. lower Styria is the home to many Slavs making a clear cultural divide of the duchy as well with the highlands inhabited by Germans and the lowlands by Slavs. Unlike upper Austria which is very mountainous and filled with highlands. The new lower Styria is filled with beautiful forests, open country, and rolling green hills. Making lower Styria the breadbasket of the duchy. The main product of the region would be cattle, all kinds of it, everything from sheep to cows."
 hie_sty_land_monasteries: "Land of monasteries"
 hie_sty_land_monasteries_desc: "Our land was Christianized in the 8th century by the bishops of Salzburg. This was mainly done via monasteries. All over the duchy, you find monasteries in fact most cities have formed around them so in more than only religion these monasteries are the foundation of our duchy. The majority of these monasteries are either benedictine which usually are the isolated monasteries you find on top of a mountain or in the middle of a forest. These are mainly the l religious centers where strict clerical rules must be followed and serve as the clerical powerhouse of the duchy. Then the other monasteries that often lay at the foundation of most of our cities are the Jesuit monasteries. Thanks to the services of education and care they offered, most of our cities have sprung up around them. Making them the culturally religious center of our duchy."
 hie_sty_georgenberger_handfeste: "Georgenberger Handfeste"
 hie_sty_georgenberger_handfeste_desc: "By the end of the 12th century in 1189 the Otokar dynasty had all but come to an end. Ottoaker IV, the last of his line, had not produced any heir and had contracted leprosy in the holy land. To secure the future of his realm he turned north to the Duchy of Austria which was ruled by the Babenberg dynasty. They came to an agreement called the Georgenberger Handfeste or Georgenberg pact. Which effectively did two things. It binds the duchy of Austria and Styria into the new Archduchy of Austria. It's important to realize here that the name is slightly deceiving. The title of archduchy is in effect a kingdom and not a duchy. Due to the late Hohenstaufen reforms it became legally impossible to form any new kingdoms within the empire itself, but there are ways around that. One of these methods is what Prussia did and that is to include your imperial duchy into a kingdom outside of the empire. They made their title duces of Brandenburg Kings in prussia not of prussia, the wording is legally important. A second method is what the Babenbergs did in Austria. Requesting the pope to elevate a duchy title to an Archduchy giving its Arch dukes divine right which usually is exclusive to kings. But by request they were given divine rights and united Austria and Styria into an Archduchy. The second thing that it did was to secure the autonomy and independence of Styria from The duchy of Austria within the archduchy. Making them diplomatically, Legally, economically and militarily independent from the duchy of austria. Only swearing loyalty to the Archduke of Austria and not the duke of Austria."
 hie_sty_vertrag_von_neuberg: "Vertrag von Neuberg"
 hie_sty_vertrag_von_neuberg_desc: "In 1278 the austria was reconquered by the first Habsburg emperor Rudolph I from the hungarians. He gifted Styria and Austria to his sons to make sure there would be no infighting between the two branches of the dynasty. In 1379, the treaty of Neuberg was drawn up. This treaty did four things: it basically reformed the rich duchy of Austria. It made it legally so that only the descendants of Rudolf I could sit on its throne, this included Austria propper and styria. The third thing it did was that it divided it among two lines. The primary line of the eldest known as the Albertine line where the rule austria propper and the arch duchy. This consisted of Upper and proper austria, upper austria regarded to the Habsburg ancestral swabian bavarian and swiss lands. With Austria propper being the duchy of Austria itself. Second was the leopoldian line who would be given exclusive legal ownership over the duchy styria the Windic march or slovenia today and lastly the march of istria. Creating inner Austria as a unity and effectively centralizing the state before it was cool. It however retired the title styria unless the austrian crow was to be split again in that case it would become styria once more. With the last one being a general reference to the austrian owned italia lands. Lastly it reverted one of the still in effect Georgenberg pact agreements. That is the one of legal independence from now on the legal code of the both duchy will be the same and the legal end authority was to be the archduke of austria in both the duchy of Austria and Styria."
 hie_sty_university_graz: "University of Graz"
 hie_sty_university_graz_desc: "Established in 1585 as a joint venture between the dukes of styria and the Prince bishop of salzburg. It was established as a center for higher learning taught by monks of the intellectual catholic orders. Its focus is mainly laid on theology and Humanist sciences whatever some reformists might tell you our education isn't any less in quality nor diverse. Our university, however young, is producing not only capable and strong clergy for the actual catholics of the empire unlike some questionable ones near Frankfurt. And a great number of capable thinkinkers who can go toe to toe with the self claimed superior ones produced by the reformation."
 hie_sty_marchia_carantana: "Marchia Carantana"
 hie_sty_marchia_carantana_desc: "The duchy of Styria is part of a far greater title that was dissolved long ago. The diplomatic acquisition of the March of Carantia was the birth of our duchy; the march itself spanned from Friuli all the way to Panonia. With our new basis of power maybe it is time to restore the set march and regain the power our land once held. The old slavic rulers ight be gone but their legacy still endures in these lands. We might be Germans ourselves but styria and Carantia by extension goes beyond that. The idea has become unifying for the multicultural state and is a driving force behind the common goal to restore it."

Salians, Habsburgs, Hohenzollerns, Welfs, Hohenstaufens; all of these and more trace their lineage to the Duchy of Swabia. World-famous dynasties have arisen from these fertile soils; God willing they will continue to do so."
 hie_swa_schwabischer_stadtebund: "Schwäbischer Städtebund"
 hie_swa_schwabischer_stadtebund_desc: "The “Swabian League” saw various iterations starting in the 14th century. Like the more famous Hanseatic League, it was a group of free cities and other smaller political entities who realized that working together allowed them to pool resources to defeat a much larger and more centralized foe. Unlike the Hansa, it grew to eventually include theocracies and smaller duchies as well, keeping ambitious dukes, unruly peasants, opposing confederations ( especially the Swiss), and even Imperial tyranny in check."
 hie_swa_landsknechte: "Landsknechte"
 hie_swa_landsknechte_desc: "Founded by Emperor Maximillian as a direct response to the feared Swiss mercenaries, the Landsknechts would become one of Germany's first professional armies. Known for their combined arms tactics, their fearsome two-handed swords that could decapitate four men in a single swing, and their disciplined formations, these soldiers would quickly become a staple mercenary core throughout Central Europe. From using their Zweihanders to punch through enemy formations, to providing a rallying point for other units, these units formed the core of a far more effective melee force."
 hie_swa_reichsfreiheit: "Reichsfreiheit"
 hie_swa_reichsfreiheit_desc: "Ever since the first Frankish incursions into the lands of the Suebi, through the magnificent reign of Frederick Barbarossa, the Great Interregnum, and the Habsburg Monarchy, the emperors have always recognized Swabian privileges, called Reichsfreiheit. Literally “Imperial Freedom,” also known as “Imperial Immediacy,” this was a privileged status that made the Swabian city-states answer to no lord but the Emperor himself. In practice, this resulted in a high degree of self-governance, creating a balance of power and healthy competition between states in times of peace, while allowing for much more power as a whole in times of war. Even when the Duchy is re-united, the strength of local ties and decentralized government is a valuable lesson for us."
 hie_swa_divided_faith_united_purpose: "Divided in Faith, United in Purpose"
 hie_swa_divided_faith_united_purpose_desc: "Perhaps partly due to the highly decentralized politics of the region, Swabia saw more religious diversity during the Reformation than any other part of the empire. Protestants, Catholics, and Reformed jostled for converts here; but, unlike other regions, we largely avoided religious conflicts between the faiths, realizing that such a conflict could only do more harm than good. That we have learned to live and prosper together will be a strength even after the fractured city-states are long gone."
 hie_swa_swabian_circle: "Swabian Circle"
 hie_swa_swabian_circle_desc: "Every elector was granted by the emperor a set circle of influence. These circles of influence were all of equal distance and size but were only limited to the elector titles the individual had. Swabian princes were not directly involved in the creation of HRE Circles, nor did they have their own elector. This allowed them to cooperate, using their assigned Swabian circle to great effect. With its capital in the imperial free city of Ulm, and the major influence of bishoprics and abbeys competing with free cities and duchies, the Swabian Circle proved surprisingly effective by combining the best of theocratic, republican, and monarchical institutions."

Whatever our creed, our culture teaches and enshrines ideas of industriousness and hard work on behalf of one's community. From the Fugger bankers to the famed textile mills founded in the 13th century in Upper Swabia, our culture has built Swabia as the beating economic heart of Germania."

 hie_swi_drills_drums_desc: "As part of both the tradition of working as mercenaries abroad and of serving their cantons at home, the Swiss have developed a unique culture of drill and training that ensured they kept their traditional edge as the masters of European infantry. As part of this effort, they were the first to incorporate drumbeats into their infantry training, giving their infantry just that much more precision."

 hie_swi_three_languages_one_culture: "Three Languages, One Culture"
 hie_swi_three_languages_one_culture_desc: "One Culture: While many consider language and culture to be closely linked, the Swiss have never accepted such limitations. The shared heritage, traditions, customs, and values unite the Alpine people whether they speak German, Italian, or French. The adoption of these values is what is important, not the local dialect."
 hie_swi_debate_religious_issues: "Debate Religious Issues"
 hie_swi_debate_religious_issues_desc: "The fires of the Reformation sweep through our neighbors, threatening to consume all sides in the same flame of righteous indignation. Unique among the nations of Europe, Swiss cantons applied their centuries-old democratic principles to the religious question: calm, reasonable debate, rather than the sword, can determine questions of faith here."
 hie_swi_the_calling: "The Calling"
 hie_swi_the_calling_desc: "One of the greatest contributions of the Swiss Reformation to the world was the idea of the calling as identified by Weber: that not only is a job well done its own reward, but that all work, no matter how 'worldly,' can be divinely appointed as a calling. This motivates everyone from the lowest peasant to the wealthiest banker to dedicate much more of their energy to their vocations."
 hie_swi_universal_conscription: "Universal Conscription"
 hie_swi_universal_conscription_desc: "As the age of mercenaries came to a close, the Swiss sought to maintain both their martial spirit and their republican system by instituting one of Europe's first universal conscription laws.

Since then it has seen many people come and go. It has survived empires like Rome the merovingian and the carolingian empire. They have all since passed into history but Thuringia and its people haven't. Our land people and our name are older than anyone in the empire and to an extent europe."

They may seem meaningless to the ignorant eye but to the thuringians it is more than just a title. It has become our motto. We Stand guard at the Sorbian frontier even though the Sorbians are  long gone now. We have come to expand its meaning that we stand guard at the imperial frontier and if they don't want us we'll stand guard for ourselves. This ideal has pushed our people and its culture to be a heavily militarized one. We are continuously preparing for conflicts that may or may not come but  it is better to be prepared then it is not to be."

So a large number of castles and forts date back to our ancient purpose. But it has instilled an experience and love for fortification in us. We've become fortification experts. We are really proud of it to a point we set up mock battles to prove how hard it is to siege one of our castles."
 hie_thu_alte_stamme: "Alte Stämme"
 hie_thu_alte_stamme_desc: "We are a stem duchy of the empire; these stem duchies date back from both the Carolingian and the Merovingian age. The word stem in this case comes from the old germanic stäm or tribe. So, these stem duchies are the feudalized states of those tribes. The Alte Stämme or ancient tribes can be traced back to the merovingian empire which is not yet the Holy Roman Empire. There are six: the Franks, Thuringians, Bavarians, Frisians, swabians and the saxons. With the formation of the Empire this being the Holy Roman Empire the following duchies were added to the stem duchies and some old stem duchies were renamed. The frankish stem duchy was divided into Lotharingia and Franconia. All the rest remained the same. What this means is that Thuringia is has ancient if not older then the holy roman empire. We are an integral part of it; we are literally part of the foundation of the empire. Sadly our numbers are dwindling. The swabians have fractured the franks and their duchies are long gone even though there are some legitimate efforts to revive them. Saxony is simply no more and its attempt for revival isn't even within saxony of old; it's a pathetic attempt at former greatness. Bavaria is also in tatters and divided. There are only 2 left of the ancient foundations: the thuringians and the frisians. All these other younger duchy claim to have legitimacy but they arent and it's pathetic. Maybe it is time we retake our birthright as one of the last founders of the empire."
 hie_thu_sangerkrieg: "Sängerkrieg"

We had become the center of High German culture until our fall from grace in the  thuringian succession. Now if this legendary contest actually happened is up for debate and quite surely some of it has been exaggerated but it reminds us of a time we were the cultural heart of the German people. However the cultural influence of the Thuringians has never really disappeared; it just moved from court to court. After our succession crisis it was moved to the von Wettin court. But now that we have regained our own independence it is time we retake our cultural dominance."

They have since left and created their own state farther up north. but their influence remained; they were here for a solid three centuries. To this day teutonic knights heavily recruit in the area so the expertise hasn't left either. They primarily taught us how to utilize heavy armor and resist the horse based armies of the slavs. They also instilled a great sense of duty in our career soldiers and aristocracy."

 hie_thu_thuringian_succession_desc: "We were one of the most if not the most important duchy in the empire during the high middle ages, the center of German culture with a strong economy and strong military. But this all came to a halt when our large duchy had a succession crisis which effectively split our dynasty in three. House von Hesse, von Wettin, Brabant and our main line remained in Thuringia. Eventually our line in brabant would die out and our main line would as well.

While at the same time killing invading armies unfamiliar with the terrain. We have developed a specific way of farming to survive here.

The mountains keep us safe and fed; they are truly our friends."
 hie_tir_imperial_passes: "Imperial passes"
 hie_tir_imperial_passes_desc: "The Reshen and Brenner passes are known as the imperial passes for one simple reason; for one they are the two most traveled passes in the empire. Not only for trade but as diplomatic routes too. This brings me on to the second reason these passes were often traveled by the emperor or his dignitaries to and from italie for every reason between meeting the pope being crowned or just visiting italian courts for legal or diplomatic reasons. This means these passes might possibly be the safest routes in Europe and it's our duty to safeguard them."

 hie_tir_de_jure_flexibility_desc: "Our de Jure loyalty has changed so many times over the centuries it has become legally unclear. Originally we were part of the italian kingdom, during the carolean kingdom we then transferred to Bavaria, and then in the 13th century with the forming of the archduchy of austria it changed again. Although none of these changes were legally formalized within an imperial diet, this left the aur de Jure ruler legally ambiguous. This gives us a lot of power in that fact that our de jure liege is at our mercy in regards to levies and taxes especially for we do not owe anything to our non de jure lieges.

The nickname stuck and ever since our duke has been given the nickname kingmaker as long as a von Habsburg would fill its throne. The nickname is more than a nickname however it has become somewhat of an imperial title. It has become a term of respect within imperial circles and one that carries quite a bit of weight at that."

This would be achieved by creating a representative or a “Vogt.” This was an elected cleric who not only took charge of the clergy within the league but served to represent the bishop's title as well. This way, both the people and the clergy were represented at once. This resulted in an autonomous republic under the suzerain protection of the bishops of Chur. giving both parties what they wanted. Independent cities but clerical oversight."
 hie_ttl_gray_league: "Gray League"
 hie_ttl_gray_league_desc: "The gray league was an alliance of cities and aristocrats. They decided to band together to secure and police the local region after the death of the last of the ruling family. Instead of subjegating themselves to the austrains they formed a military alliance and held their independence."
 hie_ttl_league_ten_jurisdictions: "League of ten jurisdictions"
 hie_ttl_league_ten_jurisdictions_desc: "This league was formed without any aristocratic presence. This makes it a league by the people for the people. They would set an example for all of the common folk in Europe that it didn't take aristocrats to have a functioning society. This league would have its democratic values at its core and with the joining of the leagues this would extend to all of the three leagues."
 hie_ttl_three_leagues: "The Three Leagues"
 hie_ttl_three_leagues_desc: "The unification of the leagues is an unprecedented event in history. They in effect would form Europe's first federal republic. Of which one republic is purely a democratic one the other is one with a clerical but elected representative. And one being a military alliance of cities and local lords to secure their independence and form a republic out of necessity. The unity of these three would send a clear message to Europe being a legit challenge to the current established order of their age."
 hie_ttl_expanding_league: "Expanding the league"
 hie_ttl_expanding_league_desc: "The leagues often have many that petition to join for various reasons. Some join for safety, others for economic reasons. Since under our league system we can't really accept states to join so these cities that join have to pledge a loyalty to one of the existing leagues. Which creates an interesting political situation but makes joining cities and villages much more efficient but it takes time to officially be included in a league."
 hie_ttl_landfrieden: "Landfrieden"
 hie_ttl_landfrieden_desc: "These local codes first founded in the gray league where a set of codes that would crack down hard on crime. While at the same time securing liberties. They were bcs of their effectiveness implemented all over the three leagues. Which caused centralization of the state in a legal sense the used a universal legal code among all the leagues which was clear and effectively enforced."

 hie_ttl_control_over_alpine_passes_desc: "With the unity of the league we have secured what all three of the leagues wanted to secure control over the trade in the passes. Creating thi security and strength has made it so that more and more traders opt to pass through our valleys. And we hope to keep encouraging this the safety of our home has finally been achieved now let the traders come or we will come to them. That's not a threat but a promise."

 hie_wes_mountains_deep_forests_desc: "The terrain in our duchy carries some legendary names. For example Teutenberg or the hills of Ersne. Our people are skilled defenders and utilize the terrain to its full potential, letting armies overstretched and divide themselves in the difficult terrain of our duchy. This has become our military calling card. We let them die slowly and throw themselves at the mercy of the climate and strike while they are weak. Appearing out of the forest and disappearing just as quickly."
 hie_wes_people_not_state: "A people not a state"
 hie_wes_people_not_state_desc: "The duchy and kingdom of Westphalia are very much a modern construct. The only reason we exist was because the old Saxon kingdom and later duchy was split off after the desecration of “the Lion”. There are 3 regional Saxon cultures in old Saxony: Westphalia, Angrian, and Estphalian. We are the only ones with a direct duchy of our own. It is our land, our people, we aren't a mere state, we are a people first and a duchy and kingdom second."
 hie_wes_imperial_founding: "Imperial founding"
 hie_wes_imperial_founding_desc: "After the desecration of Henry “the Lion,'' we were elevated to a duchy by the emperor Barbarossa. We didn't ask for this but we aren't ungrateful we preferred of course to remain saxony. We have been thrown into the political game that is the empire needing to adapt quickly and learn how to administer and run a state. How to diplomatically operate within the Holy Roman Empire as well. We are simple and very traditional people. When things change here they take time and do so slowly. We didn't have that luxury, however."
 hie_wes_westphalian_way: "Westphalian way"
 hie_wes_westphalian_way_desc: "This is the continuation of the Roman roads that started in Cologne. Over the course of the middle ages, this road was extended all the way to Hamburg and in a minor capacity to Jutland. Because a majority of the road runs through Westphalia it was nicknamed the Westphalian Way. This road ran through the majority of our big cities effectively. We control the road and the trade that runs over it. It is ours to tax and it is ours to take first pick of the goods."
 hie_wes_catholic_saxons: "Catholic Saxons"
 hie_wes_catholic_saxons_desc: "Our brethren have all turned their back on the catholic faith, the faith we have bled for they so easily betray. Our ancestors resisted Christianization with a great effort which was the reason in the first place we converted. Our brethren seem to have forgotten the Saxon blood spilled for the catholic faith we are bound to it. The Reformation had some effect in Westphalia that is true but we are Catholics first and with Bavarian support we shall keep it that way."
 hie_wes_westphalian_system: "Westphalian system"
 hie_wes_westphalian_system_desc: "The Westphalian system was something that had evolved in the aftermath of the peace of Westphalia. It effectively ended the idea of traditional feudalism. The Westphalian system states that each state has exclusive sovereignty over its territory, people, and its laws. While also holding sole control over its ability to conduct warfare. This ended feudalism in the sense that lords, counts, dukes, and kings no longer had to adhere to the laws of the superior de jure title. They from now on had the liberty to conduct warfare and manage their lands and states in the way they deemed fit. The only feudal requirement that was left standing was that you owed de jure taxes to your overlord. All the other pillars of feudalism like levies imperial law on a local level and religious adherence to your overlord were all torn down. This system would usher in the age of imperialism and centralization."
 hie_wes_old_saxony: "Old Saxony"
 hie_wes_old_saxony_desc: "Old Saxony died centuries ago and its current iteration is rather pathetic. We are not only in actual Saxony but we have reached a point where we can exercise control over the region and unite the true Saxons under a true Saxony. It might no longer be named Saxony but our people understand what we are fighting for and what we are defending. It is time we reunited Germany's most powerful duchy. The one that for a time managed to keep Charlemagne ad bay the one that destroyed Roman legions. This is Saxony true Saxony our Saxony."

And first, it was the Saxons, then the Swabians, and now it's these Swiss Austrians. This perfectly sums up the political climate within the empire; it's a cutthroat political system. And we are thriving in it, in a poetic way it's the law of the empire. Enforcing the law of the strongest, well the law of the diplomatically savvy and most numerous soldiers. Allegiances flip like coins during a game of cards. You either take part in it or get subjected by the ones that do."

 hie_gos_ostsiedlung_desc: "Translated as “East Settlement,” this was the repopulation of ancestral Germanic homelands by an ever-burgeoning and militarily stronger German population. Our people need the living space, and only so many forests can be felled before we have to push east into the lands of the Slavs. This practice started in earnest in the 12th century and continued through the establishment of marches, trade cities, and military orders. The culmination and best-known of these endeavors was the Germanization of Prussia by the Teutonic Order. The end result was that lands from the Elbe River to the Gulf of Riga, once German, then Slavic and Balt, were now German again."
 hie_gos_saxon_heritage: "Saxon Heritage"
 hie_gos_saxon_heritage_desc: "These lands were once the home of most if not all of the Germanic tribes that later migrated into the Roman Empire. These tribes are long gone, but the Saxons stayed and thrived in their ancestral homeland, sticking to their woods, coasts, and towns in the face of nomadic invasions, Norse raids, and Frankish subjugation alike. The Saxons have always proven hardy warriors and since the earliest days of the Empire have been prized for their military prowess in defending the softer richer heartlands. We are the proud heirs of this legacy and our father's prowess of old still inspires and guides us."
 hie_gos_hansa: "Hansa"
 hie_gos_hansa_desc: "With sandy poor soils, no mineral wealth, and a poorer climate than further south, northern Germans enjoy far less natural wealth than their southern German cousins. Their one signature advantage lay in their access to the Baltic Sea and many navigable rivers connecting to it. So, a characteristic feature of northern German realms was their deep investment and involvement in trade. This was best illustrated by the Hanseatic League, but all realms of northern Germany had a vested interest in trade, whether they could properly be called trade cities and republics or not."
 hie_gos_eastern_northern_marks: "Eastern and Northern Marks"
 hie_gos_eastern_northern_marks_desc: "From the earliest Merovingian conquests to the Habsburg-dominated empire, the north has always been seen as the frontier: the last outpost of civilization bordering uncivilized lands to the north and east. The concerns of the empire lie elsewhere, and so they have given us, the local people, both the freedom and the responsibility to bear arms and defend ourselves, and special rights to fortify our cities and maintain large independent armies. When an assembly of the Men of the Mark is called, they will answer."
 hie_gos_vernacular_german: "Vernacular German"
 hie_gos_vernacular_german_desc: "Being separated by great distances from the centers of legal and religious power, who in any case were largely concerned elsewhere, plus the demands of a heavily trade-oriented economy, the northern Germans abandoned Latin in favor of written German very early on. Records, laws, proclamations, and eventually works of literature were increasingly written in German, which led to an early standardization. It was no accident that Northern Germany eventually spawned “Standard German,” as well as the first translations of key works such as the Bible into German. Besides, who wants to hear a German speak Latin anyway?"
 hie_gos_integrated_firearms: "Integrated Firearms"
 hie_gos_integrated_firearms_desc: "The invention in northern Germany of the wheel-lock pistol, along with advances in tactics borrowed from Swiss, Spanish, and Dutch armies led to a revolutionizing of both infantry and cavalry weapons and tactics in northern Germany. During the Schmalkaldic War, the first and arguably only real league war, Protestant northern Germans acquitted themselves well with these armaments. By standardizing cavalry pistols, for example, cavalry was able to consistently engage at range and avoid charging formidable pike squares. Meanwhile, infantry was able to engage in melees far more effectively with more extensive firearm usage.

Tribes like the Goths, Burgundians, and Langobards all call it home at one point or another. This shifted, however, with the rise of the Huns. The Huns who were centered around current-day Crimea displaced the Slavs in the Dnieper Valley. These Slavs then migrated west out of fear of the Huns and in turn, drove the Germans further west, starting the Germanic migrations into the Roman empire. Then during the Carolingian age, Germans started to retake these lands from the Slavs slowly Germanizing them over time.

This made it so that the Griffins have lost basically all their lands outside of Pomerania to ambitious lords or bishops.

The conversion of these slaves was such a priority for the papacy that they helped set up an official diocese as an official clerical authority over Old Wendia.

So the region from Lübeck to Prussia was without a real name in the eyes of the Germans. It was duped Slavinia ad first this title was given to Henry “the Lion” but after his death in battle against the Wendians. House von Griffin presented itself in Lübeck ad Barbarossa's imperial camp and they were given the title for requesting to carry the imperial standard into battle and leading the charges. Thanks to this the region was then divided into German and Polish duchies respectively. For their help in subduing the heathens. Poland would gain control over Pomerania and Prussia and the holy roman crown would take possession of what today is Lübeck, Mecklenburg, Nordmark, and Hamburg.

 hie_pom_pomeranian_church_desc: "A large portion of the Pomeranian aristocracy were early and zealous supporters of Luther, having been witnesses to a number of his services. They tried to implement his ideas in an ever more divided Pomerania. Pomerania at this time was divided not only on cultural axes but also on religious ones. Even before the aristocracy tried to implement Protestant supremacy, this division translated itself into a pseudo-civil war in the country between the traditionalists, mostly Slavs and Catholics, and the reformists, mostly Germans and protestants. This conflict consisted of both sides attacking each other's villages and homes, persecuting one another for heresy. Both sides would employ rather brutal tactics, being as destructive and intimidating as possible. This created a climate in which both sides saw each other as evil incarnate. This would all be put to a stop when the largely protestant nobility banded together and defeated the catholic leadership. This caused the resulting Protestant church to be an extremely zealous one and entrenched in their beliefs due to the hardships they had to endure. On the other hand, they were very much against any further religious conflict and military actions, for they had seen the damage it had caused at home. This caused for example an interesting situation in which they joined the evangelical league and supported them. But they would not and did not partake in any military engagement or refused to provide any troops."

Behold the legacy of Vanga, where the pursuit of knowledge transcends the boundaries of creed and faith. In the shadow of Islamic madrassas and the embrace of houses of learning, a tradition is upheld, a tradition as ancient as the land itself. Here, within the sacred precincts of these institutions, all are welcome to debate, to ponder, to seek the truth, regardless of their beliefs. This venerable tradition finds its roots in the distant past, in the time of Ashoka the Great, who first erected the pillars of learning around the Buddhist stupas, drawing seekers of wisdom from distant lands from the misty shores of China to the fabled realms of the Eastern Roman Empire. It was under the golden reign of the Gupta dynasty that Bengal truly flourished, for they erected six grand universities upon its soil, where the flames of knowledge burned bright and the people of Bengal were hailed as the most erudite in the known world. Though the centuries may have dimmed this luminous legacy, Bengal has seen many a renaissance and revival, for whenever peace and stability graced its lands, the fires of learning were rekindled, casting their glow upon all who dwelled within. Now, as we stand upon the precipice of a new era, let us pledge to once more fan the flames of knowledge, to reignite the ancient fires of learning that have lain dormant for too long.

Unity in division our strength comes more so from our confederation than from our defensive capabilities. Of course, the terrain did help a lot too."
 hie_dng_longhouses: "Longhouses"
 hie_dng_longhouses_desc: "Due to the limited space within the very slim and elongated valleys, the best way to build here is in the form of longhouses. These houses are quite literally true to their name here: long slender buildings built on terraces hugging the shape and flow of the mountainsides they were built against. The term longhouse does not do this type of construction justice, however. One has to imagine multi-storied buildings made of stone using the very mountain itself on one side, as its foundations while looking over a cliff or a decent on the other side."
 hie_dng_mustard_farmers: "Mustard farmers"
 hie_dng_mustard_farmers_desc: "For centuries our people have been renowned for their skill in getting the difficult mustard plant to thrive especially in our mountainous region. This still rather expensive seed is beloved in cuisines far and wide, earning us a pretty penny. Being the only ones in the region to farm and effectively cultivate the plant gives us somewhat of a localised regional monopoly on mustard growth and trade. Our people keep its unique process a highly valued and cultural secret."

 hie_dng_guardians_of_the_trade_passes_desc: "While many view the Himalayas as a wall to be circumvented rather than traversed, our people have found ways through the mountains. These “secret” passages through the mountains are of such high importance the safekeeping of these paths are vital to not only our economy but also the safety of our people. These paths would be used as secret ways for our population to escape during war or to make sure a rival army could not move around or flank our defensive positions."
 hie_dng_utilising_the_rivers: "Utilising the rivers"
 hie_dng_utilising_the_rivers_desc: "The many valleys are home to even more rivers big or small. These rivers are highly important for the water supply of our people. The many sources of water make the need for water nigh non-existent. Starting in the 9th century some smart traders realised that the annual melt run would collect in the centre of the valley and create somewhat of a massive flood down the centre of the valley. They devised a plan where they would collect this massive annual melt flood in an artificial lake. They would then carve out a single direction small canal in the centre of the canal and gradually release the water over time in a steady fashion. This together with a specialised flat bottom boat created somewhat of a highway system down the valleys. This one way transport routes proved to be vital during war, extremely handy for trade and aided greatly in moving big heavy stones from the quarries higher up in the valley. To the more workable and flat terrain of the lower valleys."

 hie_dti_the_3_worlds_desc: "Doti was known as the land of three worlds, stemming from the fact the kingdom encompassed three different climates. Each is like entering three separate worlds of their own. In the lower valleys, one could find oneself in the tropical and the subtropical. Among the river mangroves, lush jungle-like forests and very fertile and suitable lands for agriculture. Following the rivers upstream, one would quickly discover the moist heat dissipating into the temperate forests and highlands of the central valley. Perfectly suited for habitation of large cities and practising animal husbandry. Once again moving upstream to where the rivers turn into waterfalls and eventually glaciers we meet the last of these three worlds. The high alpine rock valleys of the Himalayas. Being unfit for most forms of agriculture it is here that our fabled copper mines and the trees and stone we build originate from, with its strong granite and high spruces."

 hie_dti_the_copper_kings_desc: "The nickname given to our kings, due to how they amassed their wealth. By royal decree, all copper within our kingdom belonged to the crown. Not only vital for religious purposes with most tools being made out of copper. It was also the metal of choice to adorn yourself in, within the Himalayan kingdoms. It is worth twice its weight in gold all over the Himalayas. The ownership of the richest copper mines in all of our great mountains made us rich beyond our wildest dreams."

Defining our eastern and western borders excluding the mountains are two strong and continuously flowing rivers. The fact they are continuously flowing is very rare for the region. These rivers somewhat create a moat around the fertile valleys reinforced by steep mountain cliffs. With a feature so defining it that gave us the name of our kingdom, these rivers have become somewhat of a source of pride and mystical power, believing its waters have healing and protecting properties."

 hie_dti_doti_vaults_desc: "Over time it became clear to our aristocracy and kings that just having all your wealth from the copper mines and trade out on display or in palaces is not that good of a decision. So the construction of a massive set of vaults and complimentary bureaucracy was created. Effectively creating one of the first treasuries in the world. Even turning these vaults into somewhat of a banking system for the rich and the noble who are able to rent a space to deposit all their physical wealth or store items of great value. These vaults were dug right into the high mountains and took at least a full day of travel before reaching the nearest urban centre. This was done on purpose however, thieves loaded with precious metals and objects won't get far with such a big load in these mountains, and gold or copper does not keep you fed or hydrated."

His early but revolutionary reforms from the 9th century are still at the foundation of our government and kingdom. The reforms lay both the foundations for the natural state of our kingdom and how it should be governed. They dictate the social structure of our state dividing the state in three with each behind headed by one family. These three families would be given responsibilities in line with what we would think of as estates. One of the families would be responsible for maintaining their home region and the military. Another would then be responsible for their home region and everything pertaining to the economy. And lastly the family responsible for religious matters and their home region.

Our mountains and valleys are littered by more forts than one could count.

The line of Yadu or the lunar line gave birth to many different epic dynasties from the Pandya’s Cheras of the tamil kings. To the Maurya dynasty of Ashoka the great, and of course our humble dynasty at least our branch. Related to the Guhilot dynasty which also birthed the Sisodiyas of Mewar and Chauhans one of the most ancient and prestigious lines in all of the Rajputana. Lastly, the lunar lineage also gives us a connection to the great line of the ancient Parmaras of the Malivi kingdom of old. While this establish connection to one of the most revered lines in vedic history and the last of the surviving devine lines created by Shiva itself. It also sets the example of the rulers we are supposed to be the lunar kings as ordained by the gods.

It is our process that we have discovered through trial and error over centuries that gave us our methods which we protect fiercely. While for now this only world for silver we are also perfecting our ways to purify other precious metals. While we might not have most of it in quantity ours will be the purest you've ever seen.

Unlike the European concept of a court this is not just your throne room filled with you highest officials who act as advisors. No, what a Darbar is, is in effect the ruling heart of the state. It is where laws are made and enforced, it is where judges preside over the highest cases, where the ministers of the land come together to discuss the day to day and advise the king on what laws to enact next. It is the place where wars are planned from and commanded from in the theoretical sense. It's where the young nobility get their education, and where the king holds his court to be sure, but that's a rather banality of what goes on at large. It also functioned as an early form of university, a place where the funded arts and sciences by the court presided. Lastly it also serves as the highest religious authority on the simple notion that the highest religious ranks of the religions within the kingdom also preside in the Darbar. Effectively becoming a think tank, supreme court, royal court, war room, and university all in one."

Few if not none use them like we do. They are still a very vital cultural instrument, yes but with the right technique we found out we can make them drum and hum at a very low rhythmic sound. This does not only sound very intimidating and threatening but has proved to induce a sort of trance on our own soldiers making them fight all the more fiercely and more devoted. Soldiers claiming it feels like the wrath of the gods is put into them. What we have also learned and found out is that this sounds even more intimidating in caves and acoustic impressive spaces."

We have however learned to appreciate and in fact fall in love with these weapons. From pistols to rifles all the way to the biggest cannons. We use all of them and have proven to us all of them to great effect one might even call it an obsession. Rigging first with far more canons then we need all the more creative ways to utilise canons on the battlefield. To being the first army ever to employ professional sniper units and hold marksman training. Between this and our unique form of wardrum we use we have truly become thunder warriors. Highly disciplined, good with guns and sounding extremely scary while approaching.

In the distant mists of time, before any human states were known, our land was home to the ancient cities and clans of gods and demi-gods. As these times receded into myths, the importance of this blessed patch of earth endured. At the very height of the Delhi Sultanate of old, this was known as the capital province. Mayhaps some of the ancient blood of the demigods runs nearly true in its inhabitants, giving them a nobler birth. Or perhaps, for the sceptics and wags among us, it merely shows that the land is destined for greatness due to its position. In either case, our capital is the capital of kings and emperors.

However being out to war or on campaign doesn't withhold anyone else from declaring war and invading you. This is where our women come in, during our uncountable wars to rid our homeland of the muslim invaders we had to rely on them more then once if not more than a hundred times. The most prime example of this is when the queen of Gwalior martialled 1500 women inside of the city to uphold their motherly duties and defend their households and their children. Picking up arms with no training or some never having seen a bow, a sword mace or axe. Yet with little choice they filled their queen to the walls and held steady against their invaders repelling three attacks. The invading army completely demoralised from being defeated by mere females left. While some claim this is utter legend and others claim this as fact either way it's a nice ideal to live towards and speaks great volumes of the strength, bravery and resistance that the women of Gwalior stand for."

Thanks to the beauty and skill of our jain masons who have worked away every military practicality as best they could with the beauty of the stone, with skill unmatched even by nature. This had a benefit of a strange nature, the defensive structures in the walls and the reinforced palace blended in so well it became clear or rather unclear where exactly the defenders where.

Which if you know the british is quite the feat in all honesty. It's hard to impress a bunch of self centred arrogant pricks with a god complex who believe in their own form of weird epicurean logic.

Having grown so strong in their absence and away from their rule shoving their incapabilities in their faces and irving their long narrative of the lesser hindus wrong. And it is for this exact reason we have to keep on making the city and its structures continuously more impressive. As a silent form of rebellion towards the muslims.

What happens is that the original culture starts to adopt the persian language culture and religious practices and hybridizes it with their own. Now that we have the technical aspect down, we can talk about what this meant to the people of golkonda in practice. While persian did indeed become the language of the nobility and the court the language in itself did not become widely spread. What did happen was the control of the hindu faith and the dominance of the shia faith in higher society while hindus could no longer publicly observe their faith and temple visits being only allowed on certain dates.

Due to this foundation of unity we have been able to mould through the nobility and the courts to proliferate this new universal Hindustani culture. Unifying our people under the newly formed idea that is hindustan on a cultural level. This cultural united front, at least on its major aspects, projects strength unity and more importantly a new cultural bastion. Keeping the unique parts of local cultures while making sure in broad strokes they all have common ground.

Madrassas are in effect houses of discussion, learning and education. First and foremost it is known as the house of many faiths. This means that all faiths, heathen or heretic are allowed to argue their faith here in front of our imams. Over time however it evolved beyond this it became a place where ideas and faith would be shared where the young would educate themselves for free by these religious leaders who are present. Hindustan is a land of many faiths and per the rules of the madrassa we need to provide a priest or spiritual leader for every faith in hindustan present.

We now need to standardise the army, working with levies becomes harder and harder. Local warriors for many different regions who all have different ideas on how to fight, what to fight with and how to use weapons. This does nothing but create internal conflict leaders trying to prove each other wrong by having the army devolve into a bunch of primitive hoard-like units with no unity or cohesion. It is for these reasons we have made the task of training, arming and recruitment of troops an issue of the crown and the crown alone. No longer do local leaders have the right to establish units of their own in fact the notion to do so is high treason.

For the integration of guns as the standard weapons of the armies of the deccan to the specialist cannoneers of Berar. especially the latter has become an integral part of our armies. These initial defensive cannoneers have since learned to adapt their skills to the battlefield, creating one of the most efficient and hard hitting canon tactics of the sub content. They would bring the cannon in front of the army bombarding the enemy as they approached. When the enemy came to close the army itself would move in front of the canons. The canons would then reposition to the flanks or elevated position decimating the enemy back line and picking off routing troops. This modern artillery core combined with our cavalry and our gunpowder infantry would create a deadly combo of overlapping fields of fire with a mobile element to chase down the remaining enemy troops."

The land tax became the principal form in which the peasant's surplus was expropriated by the ruling class. A 50% tax on agricultural produce, the maximum allowed by the Hanafi School, was imposed in a substantial part of northern India. Alauddin also eliminated the intermediary Hindu rural chiefs, and started collecting the Kharaj directly from the cultivators. He did not levy any additional taxes on agriculture, and abolished the cut that the intermediaries received for collecting revenue. Alauddin's demand for tax proportional to land area meant that the rich and powerful villages with more land had to pay more taxes."

While not directly allied we were dynastically and familiarly deeply connected with each other. This actually created a sort of cultural link between us making the exchange of artisans and wise men very common. It also means that the nobility of our state often travel between each other keeping a special indirect bond between the two states. We aren't connected on a leadership level but our people feel like they are both extremely related and saying you're from Mewar or Jumla doors would open on principle alone."

This piqued our interest much like Buddha, a god we haven't heard about, maybe even one we can integrate into the pantheon. However, it became clear rather quickly that they weren't interested in such conversation in fact the notion of multiple gods seemed rather insulting to them. Nonetheless, their education of the poor and the lower castes was well appreciated. They would even gather a small group of followers and we allowed them to build a church. These Christians would start to exclude themselves from the community treating us as “different” one could say, nevertheless, we maintained a civil relationship. They were allowed their faith in return for their education but other than that the relationship had become rigid and transactional."

Scholars and sufis from far and wide including Persia and Syria visited Jaunpur. Even after the decline of the Sharqi kingdom, Jaunpur remained significant as a seat of learning and culture. Sher Shah, the founder of the Suri dynasty, was sent by his father Hasan Khan Sur for the purpose of education from Sasaram to Jaunpur. Islamic religious education, particularly the Quran, hadith, tafsir, fiqh, usul-i fiqh, nahv, mantiq and several other subjects, were taught in the centers of learning here. Bibi Raji, the first and favourite queen of Ibrahim Sharqi, established some madrasas here for the girls. The fame of the scholars of Jaunpur reached far and wide, even abroad. When Humayun migrated to Persia in exile, the Safavid ruler Shah Abbas enquired from him about the state of the scholars and sufis of Jaunpur. Humayun was very much impressed to learn about the fame of the Jaunpur scholars in Persia. When he regained power in India, he attempted to restore the glory of Jaunpur that was devastated by Sikandar Lodi. Humayun's successors continued this policy.

While at the same time creating a more popular form of buddhism which kept it alive in the face of the rise of islam and christianity in the buddhistic homeland.

For the longest time we only mined exactly what we needed, finding metals like copper iron and the making of bronze far more lucrative than the gold itself.

Just to give an example, our kingdom estimates that yearly about 800 people are lost along the roads of our kingdom from accidents, landslides and human error. Thats just regular travel marching an army along these paths is near to suicide.

Whereas in normal feudalism one would delegate to dukes lord counts etcetera. In the ladakh system the local government was delegated to the monasteries with the monks taking up all of the local judicial administrative and economical tasks.

Khukuri shock troops would use as their main weapon the bow and later on a rifle and pistols and as their secondary the Khukuri knife. They would specialise in any form of close combat situations.

While at first we resisted Gorkhas it became clear over time that their goal was to unite first Nepal then the rest of india. We thought them greedy warmongerers at first; while technically not wrong, it was wrong of us to assume. After our subjugation it became clear that their cause was noble; they wanted to unite the vedic peoples to stop further outside invasions. To end the millennials of infighting and destruction onto the land by the ward caused by it. Which then created instability which then attracted outside powers to come and invade and dictate their tyranny. We would volunteer for the most suicidal charges, take the most dangerous missions for our selves. We would charge head first into the breach so that there might be peace all the sooner. While pacifists at heart we understand that in this age we must enforce future peace with fire and steel. May the mother goddess forgive us, but this has to be done.

Glorious might and rich beyond anyone's wildest dreams, now a shadow of its former self and under muslim control it pains us to see it. Having lost our throne in the 13th century the pain of such a loss still lingers. Banished, humiliated and stripped of everything, we fled north into nepal. Rupnagar, a small village in southern Nepal is where our family eventually settled. Over the next 300 years our family started out as farmers and working in the local guard. Working our way back up in the social ladder making connections and slowly focussing more and more on a dynastic military career. Then in 1518 we would make our first real move in centuries gathering a collection of villages and minor cities and declaring the kingdom of Makwanpur. While we finally have achieved a position of power again it would be prudent if we wouldn't repeat the mistakes of the past. We were decadent, proud and full of hubris. This reset is exactly what our dynasty needed, while we harken back to the ancient glory days we appreciate the lessons we have learned in utter defeat. We have literally started in the dirt grown and new appreciation for it, and we shall instil this in our dynasty for generations to come.

The fertile plains bow to necessity, once lifeblood, now bends their back to the war effort. Rationing wisdom guides our steps. The Royal Rationing Law, etched in stone, demands sacrifice from all.

Forged out of fire and steel the Mughal empire would emerge thanks to the actions of this legendary man. In a time where gunpowder weapons would be seen as just a mere technological fars for the rich nobility to indulge in he would be the first to use them in combat in a professional sense. It's this man's actions that would convince the ottomans to start using gunpowder rifles and in turn would find its way into europe. The grandfather of the professional gunpowder unit used his rifles to devastating effect, beating 10/1 odds at times. This legacy would live on in the later mughal empire, the very empire he would found, while it's important to mention he did not do this alone he carved out his empire with extensive aid of his safavid and ottoman allies. Proving he was not only a strategic genius but a diplomatic savant, it is not everyday that these great states would lend a hand to a minor prince let alone one without land or crown.

The introduction of the Mansab-Dar officer core. While their function was more than military they played a vital role in the modern structure. Taking away the right of recruitment from the local nobility and delegating it towards officials of the state. They were created to have a more efficient form of recruitment and take away the army's loyalty to lords over that of the empire. They would also be responsible for training and maintaining the quality of the recruited troops. In line with this their duty was also to police the imperial administrators, making sure ministers, governors and Nawabs fell in line with the laws of the empire and punish corruption. Administrators were forced to report to the Mansab-Dar office to receive payment and to report back to the emperor.

His system would maintain ancient institutions for legitimacy of government while reforming and modernising them. Akbar would introduce an early form of what could be seen as universal equality before the law and government. Making extensive use of institutions such as the Diwan and the local courts to broaden and narrow their legal distinctions, to enact huge land and class reforms and put in place a very ambitious form of provincial delegation called the Subah system. The modernization of the ancient Persian systems both legal and structural came at a great cost of angering the traditional institutions. This would prove minor to the positive effects that come with a functional large state that is easily maintained and doesn't rely on ancient social contracts. Everything from functional taxations, census, the control and sponsoring of trade,rule of law, large scale construction projects and guaranteed government are one of the many effects of Akbar's reforms."

Under the Persian court traditions used by the Mughals, the emperor is the final authority. However, the introduction of the Akbarian legal reforms created a second final authority on all laws of a civil matter, it being the Judges of Judges. While the emperor is still the final authority at large for the military and religious sphere, all the civil law is presided over by the Judge of Judges in tandem with the Emperor. The second most important judge would be known as the Judge of the Armies, who would concern himself with the legal matters regarding everything military internally and externally. Judges would be appointed by the chief of charities or the emperor himself. In the lower bracket of the legal system you had Jagirdar, who were the tax collectors with their authority being extremely limited but allowed to make judgments regarding the manner of payment. The Kotwal or the local police force whose loyalty and orders would originate from the Pragana courts. Enforcing local, imperial laws and assisting the tax collectors or Jagirdar on their jobs. Further up the chain, you would find the Faujdar which was a combination of the local civil and military authority that would preside over multiple districts. This today would be closely related to provincial or state governance. Lastly are the imperial Subahdar or the Suba system, those who in today's world most closely relate to the role of governors. Them being the final authority within the Faujdar while also having a direct connection to the emperor and the Diwan.

The Mughal cannon foundry Jaigarh Fort had a massive wind-tunnel that sucked air from the high mountains into its furnace and the heated air would melt the metal. The liquid molten metal would fill a reservoir chamber and into a cannon mould in the casting pit. Most of the Mughal Cannons were massive mostly 16 ft long and had to be prepared within a single day. The Mughals also built a large ingenious mechanical device that had a precision gear system driven by four pairs of Oxen, the device was used for hollowing out the Cannon barrels. Mughal cannon production reached its zenith during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, including the most impressive of the Mughal cannons: The Zafarbaksh, which is a very rare composite cannon, that required skills in both wrought iron forge welding and bronze casting technologies.

Many muslims especially in india persia iraq the levant and egypt are still secretly part of the Shia faith. They still believe that the true line of Muhammed runs through the line of his daughter and first imam of the shia branch, his husband Ali. The domination of the Sunni cult over all of the islamic world has made believing so very difficult and being Shia in most Sunni states is punishable by death.

It is the place where wars are planned from and commanded from in the theoretical sense. It's where the young nobility get their education, and where the king holds his court to be sure, but that's a rather banality of what goes on at large. It also functioned as an early form of university, a place where the funded arts and sciences by the court presided.

There would be 29 more attempts on his life before he died each time he would kill the assassin himself. After this first assassination at 13 he would become known as the lion. At 21 he would unite the other members of the confederation into a centralised state against the new mughal extremist rulers. Being crowned the first Maharatha of Punjab and emperor of the sikh. The lion of the Punjab would continue to rule his empire for the next 12 years expanding Punjab from western afghanistan all the way to the oudh plains in the east. His example would be what served as the example of a sikh emperor and a maharaja of punjab all subsequent leaders of our great state would try to achieve the greatness of this man most of them never even coming close."
 hie_pun_the_sikh_empire: "The Sikh Empire"
 hie_pun_the_sikh_empire_desc: "Our state is the Martha of punjab first, the sikh empire second. The title of Sikh Empire is a clerical title. The fighting between Islam and the vedic faith has been going on for as long as both have existed at the same time. This infighting and invasion after invasion came often at the cost of the common man. Out of this, the sikh faith was born during the invasion of the muslim ruler of Babur Timurid. The first empire showed our first guru again how this division would create nothing but war. While the initial mughal emperors would use the sikhs to close the gap between hindu and Islam, intime the mughal emperors would grow more and more extremist and thus, even the sikhs became the enemy of those attempting to build bridges with us. Our mission has never changed, however, with time we have gathered new duties and both religions have proven themselves incapable of leading our people to peace,  now we have a chance to take up that mantle ourselves. We will lead our people in an unprecedented age of peace under our leadership. The Sikh will be the example of everything the Muslims and Hindus couldn't be."
 hie_pun_modernization: "Modernization"
 hie_pun_modernization_desc: "One of the greatest challenges to our state was the lack of modernization in the army. With the arrival of the Europeans it became clear our army was ignorantly under equipped for modern combat. While we universally introduced the use of gunpowder arms, everything from rifles to pistols all the way to siege guns was introduced. However we saw great value in the notion of mobile field artillery. Building up our more modern army around the notion of what would later be called a flying battery. Mobile sets of field guns that would be positioned in a way possible to maximise damage. Using them in front of the army for charges and then setting these guns up on the flanks to continue bombardment on the back row after the initial shock of the charche shots. This highly effective artillery use in combination with rifles is what kept the British at bay for as long as we could. The British respected us for it and after subjugation the sikh of Punjab would be integrated into the army of the East India company and later on the empire of India as a set of special forces serving in great wars all across the world, last being used during world war 1."
 hie_pun_akal_sahai: "Akal Sahai"
 hie_pun_akal_sahai_desc: "Or with god's grace became the motto of our state in the later years of our state. It had become the motto of the Sikhs, using it as a maxim of acceptance. For example, if you want something you would say with the grace of god; if you would be dying, you would say with the grace of god. This notion that all is accepted and the will of the grace of god was a rather calming set of mind. Trying to point out whatever happens is fate, it is inevitable best is to just live life. This would make the Sikh faith extremely attractive especially with the continuous uncertainty in the hindu faith, and in stark contrast to the dogmatic and judging of the islamic faith. Making the spread and propagation of the sikh faith near natural people would actually seek out our priests and temples for conversions and education."

This invitation came with a marriage proposal in our case a daughter for a daughter a son for a son. Making our dynasty the most interlinked with the former Tughlaq dynasty. It was our birthright to succeed the throne after their downfall at the hands of Timur. This bastard Uzbek upstart wannabe Genghis Khan, however, chose the sayyids of Multan over us to have a more controllable tributary state. The weak minded sayyids have stolen our throne and have done nothing to repair its former glory. Now, it shall be our turn, we shall march on Delhi and retake what is rightfully ours, the throne of Delhi, and the rule of all of Hindustan."

Running a dagger straight into the heart of the sultanate was an invasion no one could recover from. Supplanting our distant cousins and installing a puppet regime in delhi. At the same time noticing the signs of defeat a group of rogue generals among the sultans most trusted went rogue gathered their armies to them and declared states of their own in the former provinces. They would establish the false kingdoms of bahmanis, kashmir,malwa, jaunpur and bengal with multan and sindh falling into timurid hands. This destruction from both internal and external fighting is what would eventually cripple the Tughlaq dynasty. With our newly established rule over Delhi however we are in a position to reunite this grand empire. Retake the upstart rebel generals' lands back and reunite what was lost. Recover our families glory and give stability back to the subcontinent."
 hie_srh_indo_mussalman_nobility: "Indo-Mussalman Nobility"
 hie_srh_indo_mussalman_nobility_desc: "During the Mongol raids, there was a rapid change in the balance of power in Northern India as power violently shifted from the Turkic nobles to a new Indo-Mussalman nobility. The Khalji family would identify themselves with the Indian Muslim communities, and the Indo-Muslim faction would grow in strength due to the rising number of converts. With a series of assassinations, they would finally usurp the throne in 1290 and appoint their Indo-Muslim allies such as Zafar Khan (Minister of War), Nusrat Khan (Wazir of Dehli), Ayn al Mulk Multani, Malik Karfur, Malik Tughlaq, and Malik Nayk (Master of the Horse) who were famous warriors but non-Turks, which resulted in the emergence of an Indo-Muslim state. The internal administrative changes during this period allowed for rapid conquests and territorial expansion of the Sultanate into the rest of India."

 hie_srh_streamlined_diwan_desc: "Delhi is unique, in that its monarchy is highly centralised and bureaucratic. There were many departments and officials who helped the Sultan in administration. The Naib was the most influential post and virtually enjoyed all the powers of the Sultan. He had control over all the other departments. The post of Wazir was next to the Naib and he headed the finance department known as the Diwan-i-Wizarat. An Auditor-General for examining expenditure and an Accountant General for checking income worked under the Wazir. The department of religious affairs, Diwan-i-Risalat dealt with pious foundations and granted stipends to deserving scholars and men of piety. This department granted funds for the construction of madrasas, tombs and mosques. It was headed by Chief Sadr who also functioned as Chief Qazi, the head of the judicial system. Other judges and Qazis were appointed in different parts of the Sultanate."
 hie_srh_kharaj: "Kharaj"
 hie_srh_kharaj_desc: "Alauddin Khalji's taxation system was probably the one institution from his reign that lasted the longest, surviving indeed into the nineteenth or even the twentieth century. The land tax became the principal form in which the peasant's surplus was expropriated by the ruling class. A 50% tax on agricultural produce, the maximum allowed by the Hanafi School, was imposed in a substantial part of northern India. Alauddin also eliminated the intermediary Hindu rural chiefs, and started collecting the Kharaj directly from the cultivators. He did not levy any additional taxes on agriculture, and abolished the cut that the intermediaries received for collecting revenue. Alauddin's demand for tax proportional to land area meant that the rich and powerful villages with more land had to pay more taxes."

 hie_srh_zawabit_desc: "Most traditional Sultanates adhere to Sharia Law, and have integrated the principles of the Quran, such as the Jizya Tax and Tawbah, into law and the administration. When Alauddin Khalji rose to power, He transformed Delhi by introducing Zawabit, a set of regulations that supplement Muslim law in accordance with the needs of the state."
 hie_srh_stand_against_rajputana: "Stand Against Rajputana"
 hie_srh_stand_against_rajputana_desc: "Sikander Lodi would continue the conquests of his father, finally defeating the Jaunpur Sultanate and establishing new tributes. However, fearing invasion, the Rajput Raja to the south, Rana Sanga, rallied his growing realm against the Lodi's, with the riches of Gujarat and the manpower of the Malwa Plateau behind him, as well as the horse-riding Rajputs that followed him with zealotry. The clashes between them would ultimately lead to Sikander's defeat, but this could be reversed."

 hie_cas_imperator_hispaniae_desc: "Not since the Romans has the peninsula been united under one banner. However, even through the centuries-long conquest and reconquest, the identity of the Spaniae has endured. The first to claim the title Emperor of the Spanish was Alfonso VI, and the title has been claimed the the Kings of Castile ever since."
 hie_cas_castilian_language: "Castilian Language"
 hie_cas_castilian_language_desc: "Originating in the sparsely-populated borderlands between Leon and the Islamic states, Castilian has quickly caught on as the default language of the peninsula. As we continue our relentless expansion, perhaps our language may yet become one of the dominant tongues of the world!"

 hie_cat_generalitat_catalunya: "Generalitat de Catalunya"
 hie_cat_generalitat_catalunya_desc: "Long before the Enlightenment, the church, the peasantry, and the nobility of Catalonia found a unique rapprochement. A type of parliament, the Generalitat also served as a court whereby peasants and merchants alike could being grievances against the nobles and the crown, and vice versa. Preserving the unique harmony of the Catalan realm greatly strengthens the foundation of any state which deigns to rule it."
 hie_cat_catalan_constitutions: "Catalan Constitutions"
 hie_cat_catalan_constitutions_desc: "Despite the name, the Catalan Constitutions functioned more as a combination of law code and constitution rather than the more classical constitutional model. However, centralizing the law as a single body was an important reform that allowed the Catalans a much more stable society."
 hie_cat_sagramental: "Sagramental"
 hie_cat_sagramental_desc: "Far more than solely a citizen militia, the freemen of Catalonia have sword blood oaths before God and man to be ready to serve the state in times of war."
 hie_cat_catalan_galleys: "Catalan Galleys"
 hie_cat_catalan_galleys_desc: "Born of the necessity to protect our interests from the dominance of Venice and the predations of the Moors, we developed the Catalan galley. A hybrid of a traditional Byzantine dromon or Venetian galley with a sailing trade ship, this design was perfect for the more open Western Mediterranean."
 hie_cat_catalan_company: "The Catalan Company"
 hie_cat_catalan_company_desc: "Originally a band of crusaders, the men of the Catalan Company became one of the most widely-travelled mercenary bands in the Mediterranean. Alternately feared and hated by many, yet hired by more, they gained experience in lands as different as Tunis and the declining Byzantine Empire, as well as in the many wars in the Iberian Peninsula itself."
 hie_cat_consell_cent: "Consell de Cent"
 hie_cat_consell_cent_desc: "An evolution of the city institutions of Barcelona, the Consell de Cent (Counsel of the Hundred) served as an important check on royal power and corruption and created a more efficient governance for the whole realm."
 hie_cat_remenca_pagesos: "Remença de Los Pagesos"
 hie_cat_remenca_pagesos_desc: "After the War of the Peasants, we have recognized that the best way to both keep the peasants loyal while still allowing for them to work the land is to promise a way out. Unique in Europe, our system now allows peasants to buy their status as freemen. While most will not be able to take this option, the ones that do can pursue crafts and trade, while the ones that remain work all the harder to try and achieve this goal."

 hie_gal_always_armed: "Always Armed"
 hie_gal_always_armed_desc: "Legend has it that the Romans could only conquer the Galicians by stealth: by attacking at the harvest festival when Galicians by custom were unarmed they conquered the otherwise unconquerable people. Whether this actually happened or not, the lesson resounded throughout the generations: we must always maintain our arms and the use of them if we are to not fall to invasion."
 hie_gal_sanctuaria_santiago: "Sanctuaria de Santiago"
 hie_gal_sanctuaria_santiago_desc: "In his quest to spread the Gospel to the ends of the earth, St. James found his final resting place here. Over the years, the presence of his relics has become a defining aspect of Galician culture, as his cathedral at Santiago de Compostela is a pilgrimage destination second only to Rome and Jerusalem itself."
 hie_gal_camino_real: "El Camino Real"
 hie_gal_camino_real_desc: "Not only did the pilgrimages shape Galician identity, but they also provided vital revenue to the armies of the Reconquista. Eventually, a royal road was established between the Basque country and Santiago de Compostela. This created a standard 'Camino' or route for the pilgrims and made it possible for many more to visit from distant lands."
 hie_gal_fogar_breogan: "Fogar de Breógan"
 hie_gal_fogar_breogan_desc: "The ancientest legends from both Galicia and Ireland, though separated for hundreds if not thousands of years, both agree on one thing: the first inhabitants of Ireland, and possibly the entire British Isles, first set sail from Galicia. Unique and oldest of all the Spaniards, then, is our desire to take to the sea and find new lands to settle and provide new homes for our people."
 hie_gal_santiago_cierra: "Santiago Y Cierra"
 hie_gal_santiago_cierra_desc: "'St. James and Close!' This rallying cry of Galician armies has become known and feared throughout the entire peninsula. The valor of Santiago has been crucial to the Reconquista, and shows the cold iron strength of the Galician people. Never again shall these lands be conquered by foreign enemies, for God and St. James are with us!"
 hie_gal_maritime_highways: "Maritime Highways"
 hie_gal_maritime_highways_desc: "While myths claim it was built by Breogan, ancestor of both Galicia and Ireland, it is more likely that it was built by the Romans as their last outpost to the West. This, the largest and oldest lighthouse in Europe, will ever light the way for fishermen, traders, and warships alike as they venture far from the safety of the shore."
 hie_gal_irmandinos: "Irmandiños"
 hie_gal_irmandinos_desc: "The 'Brotherhood', a movement which recruited peasants and bourgeois alike to combat the crimes of the nobility, teaches our army valuable lessons. By instilling the same sense of brotherhood in our armies, we encourage those on the front lines to fight all the harder, not only for their nation and their God but for each other."

 hie_gra_al_andalus: "Al-Andalus"
 hie_gra_al_andalus_desc: "While in the past we have referred to the Muslim realms here simply by their dynastic names, such as the Umayyaad, Almohad, or Almoravid, our thinkers have invented the idea of a Muslim Spanish nation-state, named Al-Andalus. With this, we can more readily justify our aspirations to conquer the peninsula, as we are more than simply an emirate of this area, but the heirs to a nation-state; never mind that this state never actually existed."
 hie_gra_volunteers_faith: "Volunteers of the Faith"
 hie_gra_volunteers_faith_desc: "Desperate to cling on to their independence, the rulers of Granada sought to counter the influx of crusading forces by making a religious appeal of their own to preserve the last Muslim state in Western Europe. This worked wonders for the Granadans, as men arrived from throughout the Islamic world. These faithful warriors were formed into their own corps, the Volunteers of the Faith."
 hie_gra_strait_fibraltar: "Strait of Gibraltar"
 hie_gra_strait_fibraltar_desc: "In ancient times, these waters, known by the Romans as the Pillars of Hercules, were considered to be one of the far corners of the earth. We know, however, that this strait is destined for greatness as the link between Atlantic and Mediterranean by sea and between Africa and Europe by land. Because of this, our ancestors bestowed our own name on it. Jabal Tariq (Mount Tarik) is its name, a name which will ring through history for a thousand years!"
 hie_gra_use_old_build_new: "Use Old to Build the New"
 hie_gra_use_old_build_new_desc: "The strategy of our forefathers to destroy infidel buildings, only to borrow from them for our own, has never been more evident than in the citadel of Granada itself. The entire city is built of the ruins of cities from days gone by. Naturally this makes Granadan construction quite efficient."
 hie_gra_canals_cisterns_towers: "Canals, Cisterns, and Towers"
 hie_gra_canals_cisterns_towers_desc: "Granada is known as the land of pomegranates. Like the seeds of the pomegranate are its many forts, standing tall and proud against the Christian infidels. Not only are there many forts, but each is equipped with interlocking systems of canals and cisterns, guarded by towers. This triple-layered defense makes starving us out of any siege very difficult."
 hie_gra_garnata_al_yahud: "Garnata Al-Yahud"
 hie_gra_garnata_al_yahud_desc: "The Jewish People of the Book have had a spotty history in Muslim Spain. However, among all the emirates of the peninsula, Granada has been one of the most friendly to the Jews. Such was the influx of Jewish wealth and influence into the realm that other Arab states began to refer to us as Garnata Al-Yahud."

 hie_lon_order_santiago: "Order of Santiago"
 hie_lon_order_santiago_desc: "The heavy knights of the Reconquista were first gathered into a holy brotherhood by the Leonese. Noblest of all the crusading orders of Europe, the Knights were vital to the key victories of the Reconquista, including the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. Unlike other orders, entrance to the Knights was not restricted to those with certain bloodlines, and marriage of members was permitted. This ensured a much more stable and long-lasting order than most that came out of the Levantine Crusades."
 hie_lon_hidalgos: "Hidalgos"
 hie_lon_hidalgos_desc: "Originally being just another word for soldier, the Hidalgos of Spain were a breed of their own. Hardy warriors adept at all the varied terrains of the peninsula and equally capable of both ambush and open battle, these tough veterans contributed greatly to the cohesion of Spanish armies."

 hie_lon_school_salamanca: "School of Salamanca"
 hie_lon_school_salamanca_desc: "The prestigious university of Salamanca has become the center for a new school of jurisprudence as well as philosophical and economic thought. Let us patronize the learned men of the School of Salamanca and make good use of their coherent interpretations of Natural Law, Property and the Natural Rights of Man."
 hie_lon_expression_faith: "Expressions of Faith"
 hie_lon_expression_faith_desc: "While the great centers of Spanish Christendom lie in Santiago de Compostela to the north or Toledo to the south, the piety of the Leonese people is famous throughout the peninsula. From their cathedrals, 'autos de fe', and fervor of the Reconquista to the quiet meditations of our famous monasteries, Leon will ever be a bastion of faith."

 hie_mjo_privative_kingdom: "Privative Kingdom"
 hie_mjo_privative_kingdom_desc: "In the wills of the Kings of Aragon, Mallorca received the title of 'privative,' or 'exclusive' kingdom. This gave Mallorca the right of separation from Aragon should they assert it. Additionally, this gave Mallorca a de-facto independence that made the local rulers governing it more legitimate in the eyes of their people."
 hie_mjo_haven_slave_trade: "Haven for the Slave Trade"
 hie_mjo_haven_slave_trade_desc: "While slavery was all but abolished in Christian Europe, the Majorcans kept it legal. This allowed a counterpart to the North African slave raiders by granting European slavers a safe harbor."
 hie_mjo_misquelets: "Miquelets"
 hie_mjo_misquelets_desc: "The militias of the various Mediterranean Spanish kingdoms were known by different names in different places. In the islands of Majorca, they made use of a small population by training all young men to serve in the militias to defend their freedom."
 hie_mjo_lliures_morts: "Lliures O Morts"
 hie_mjo_lliures_morts_desc: "'Viurem lliures o morirem' (We live free or die) is the motto of the Catalan army and is printed on the black flags it carries. Guided by these words our men will endure, even when outnumbered and without allies for the freedom of their people."
 hie_mjo_raid_moros: "Raid the Moros"
 hie_mjo_raid_moros_desc: "The Moors have for centuries raided our coasts in search of slaves, both for labor and for… less savory purposes. It seems only right that we raid them in return."
 hie_mjo_island_harbors: "Island Harbors"
 hie_mjo_island_harbors_desc: "With a lack of natural resources, the people of the islands have become expert traders. The expansion and upgrading of our harbors capitalizes on our natural advantages, such as they are."
 hie_mjo_insular_council: "Insular Council"
 hie_mjo_insular_council_desc: "Most of the kings of the islands have come from the mainland. In order to maintain effective control over the islands, they set up councils of prominent islanders, which did much of the work of governing the land."

 hie_nav_moros_costa: "Moros en la Costa"
 hie_nav_moros_costa_desc: "The cry of 'Moros en la Costa,' first shouted by watchers in Navarra, would become known throughout Spain. The early-warning system of towers and beacons to warn of Moorish raids was key to this."
 hie_nav_follow_whale_migrations: "Follow the Whale Migrations"
 hie_nav_follow_whale_migrations_desc: "The Basque peoples of Navarra made a great living by harvesting the whales in the Bay of Biscay. As the populations decreased, however, the Basques dared to strike out and follow them on their migrations across the uncharted and treacherous Atlantic. Because of this, they were early arrivals to the New World and its abundant fisheries."
 hie_nav_navarrese_company: "Navarrese Company"
 hie_nav_navarrese_company_desc: "Kings of Navarra have a tradition of recruiting mercenary companies to do their bidding. The most famous of such companies, the so called Navarrese Company, was a group of mercenaries recruited from the Gascogne and Navarran lands and is known for its successes in fighting and securing lands in Greece."
 hie_nav_protective_trade_deals: "Beneficial Trade Deals"
 hie_nav_protective_trade_deals_desc: "Eventually, others would follow our fishermen to the lucrative new shores. However, rather than enter into conflict with them, the Navarrese thought to enter into a trade agreement with their rivals. In these deals, the two parties would agree to cooperate in exchange for keeping anyone else from learning the secrets of their source of whales and fish."
 hie_nav_royal_basque_society: "Royal Basque Society"
 hie_nav_royal_basque_society_desc: "Euskalerriaren Adiskideen Elkartea, the Royal Basque Society of Friends of the Country was founded to encourage development of Basque economy, culture and science. Founded with the profits from the Royal Gipuzkoan Company of Caracas, a monopolist in trade with Venezuela at a time, it will benefit the country greatly in the coming years."
 hie_nav_beret: "The Beret"
 hie_nav_beret_desc: "Originally invented by Basque shepherds to combat the windy Pyrenees, the beret also provides our men with a sharp and uniform appearance. By incorporating this headgear into our armies, we can more easily inspire pride in the men and create a unified and disciplined force."
 hie_nav_carlism: "Carlism"
 hie_nav_carlism_desc: "While the rest of Spain falls often into succession crises, the inheritance principles of the Kingdom of Navarra remained simple and strong. Our support of the rightful heirs would later give birth to Carlism, which would remain a political force in Spain well into the modern era. Whatever happens, we know we are fighting for the true King."

 hie_por_new_age_sail: "A New Age of Sail"
 hie_por_new_age_sail_desc: "Perched on the farthest corner of Europe and on the cold, windy Atlantic, Portugal has become a center of advancement in sailing. From the Caravel and the Carrack to the astrolabe, portolan charts, and new ways of rigging, the early modern era saw an explosion of innovation on the seas by Portugal."
 hie_por_black_swords: "The Black Swords"
 hie_por_black_swords_desc: "To more effectively use their limited men, the Portuguese came up with the use of black steel swords for their men. This way their approach would be much harder to spot, as no light reflected of their blades. This was highly effective for both land and sea-based battles."
 hie_por_early_adoption_gunpowder: "Early Adoption of Gunpowder"
 hie_por_early_adoption_gunpowder_desc: "In order to keep up with their larger neighbors, Portugal was among the earliest in Europe to adopt gunpowder and abandon the traditional ways of fighting. This would serve them in great stead through both their European wars and their colonial adventures."
 hie_por_tordesillas: "Tordesillas"
 hie_por_tordesillas_desc: "Rather than contest the upstart claims of the Castilians by force of arms, being after all weary of centuries of warfare, the Portuguese Crown came up with a diplomatic solution. By involving the Holy Father's mediation, we can not only secure our own claims to huge swathes of territory in perpetuity, but also secure our eastern neighbor as a friend rather than as a foe."
 hie_por_feitorias: "Feitorias"
 hie_por_feitorias_desc: "An evolution of the classic trading post, the Portuguese created a complex that combined production, trade hub, and military outpost in one cohesive whole. Often considered the first industrial complexes, these gave the Portuguese a decisive edge in their fledgling trade empire."
 hie_por_cartazes: "Cartazes"
 hie_por_cartazes_desc: "Despite being far from the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese system of the Cartaz has allowed them to maintain a high degree of control there. By demanding (some might say extorting) payment for a letter of a license, and declaring ships lacking such a letter to be rightful targets for seizure, we can highly increase the importance of our trading ports as well as our own merchant ships. If local traders complain that we are nothing but pirates for doing so, that is their problem."
 hie_por_portolan_charts: "Portolan Charts"
 hie_por_portolan_charts_desc: "It is not enough to simply have ships capable of braving the stormy Atlantic and leaving the Mediterranean behind. The Portolan Charts were the first accurate and exact navigation maps to exist, making it possible to maneuver more safely on the high seas and allowing Portuguese sailors to sail in the deep sea rather than hug the treacherous coastlines. This of course allowed their navy to cover far more area than was usual in the Early Modern period."

In recognition of their great service to Christendom and the unity of much of the peninsula under Fernando and Isabella, the Pope granted the title of 'Most Catholic Monarchs' as a hereditary title for the Kings and Queens of Spain."
 hie_spa_cas_casa_contracion: "Cása de Contración"
 hie_spa_cas_casa_contracion_desc: "The conquistadors took over huge swathes of the New World at lightning speeds, as the crusading fervor of the Reconquista found easy targets among the natives. In order to manage this vast empire, the first modern colonial bureaucracy, the Casa de Contracion in Sevilla, was established. Although often inefficient, this system proved durable and effective at managing Spain's unprecedented overseas empire and ensuring that el Quinto Real (the King's Fifth) of gold was paid."

We have conquered the Atlantic Ocean and have become the first truly global empire the world has ever known. We have conquered the Mediterranean, humbling the mighty and proud Muslim empires. Our ships have even sailed as far as the distant shores of China. And yet, there are still some who dare to oppose us on the sea. Our peninsula has ever been vulnerable only from the sea, and now is our chance to triumph once and for all. By decree of His Highness, King of Spain, etc. etc., it is decided. A Great, Invincible, and Joyous Armada is to be constructed, Spain’s last and best great project. Either this armada will finally conquer the seas for God, for Spain, and for the Crown, or we shall go down in a blaze of glory. But, with God on our side, what fleet can possibly oppose us?"
 hie_spa_cas_guerrilla_warfare: "Guerilla Warfare"
 hie_spa_cas_guerrilla_warfare_desc: "The idea of ambushing, irregular fighters, and raids is not new; however, the Spanish would give their name to this fighting style the world over.

We look back to the time of the Moors, not with hatred and pride, but with longing as a golden age of coexistence. We put forward the idea that, so long as we ignore certain inconvenient facts, that this golden age actually occurred and we can glean important lessons from it for our own time. Let us build from it a different Spain than the one the northerners wished to impose. Besides, if anyone disagrees with our depiction of the past, we can simply dismiss them as primitive and bigoted."
 hie_spa_and_capitulaciones_de_santa_fe: "Capitulaciones de Santa Fe"
 hie_spa_and_capitulaciones_de_santa_fe_desc: "The royal charters for establishing colonization were decreed by the monarchs of Spain in 1492, once the Spanish lands had finally been unified. With the fall of Granada came opportunities for expansions abroad, and the Andalusian cities were at the forefront. The Capitulaciones, which were signed in Granada in 1492, launched Cristobal Colon's expeditions from the southern port city of Sevilla. It was based on our experience in colonizing the Canary Islands; rather than invest the crown's money directly, a certain sum was advanced as an investment to private explorers and colonists, with the expectation that it would be paid back. In addition, various titles could be bestowed along with it, and the promise of governorship over any lands discovered and colonized. With this patronage, made possible by the wealth of southern Spain, were expeditions made possible. This was the key to Colon's expedition, and without that, he would have never sailed the seas."
 hie_spa_and_fuero_juzgo: "Fuero Juzgo"
 hie_spa_and_fuero_juzgo_desc: "The Visigoth's blood may be all but spent, their pride and dignity all but forgotten. The golden age of the Visigothic Kingdom left behind few relics of their ancient past; although many of their traditions have long since been wiped away, their law codes were preserved. Ironically, it was under the occupation of the Moors that these laws were remembered, as they applied to the non-Muslim inhabitants in parallel to the Sharia. These laws, combining the best of old Roman laws, Germanic customs, and native Iberian traditions, covered everything from inheritance and divorce to criminal laws and trade disputes, allowing a standardized code and rule of law for our people as the Reconquista progressed and Sharia was eliminated. The Fuero Juzgo was the last and best translation and summary of the laws, codifying them in the emerging Andalusian dialect from old Visigothic in the 14th century."
 hie_spa_and_bridging_christian_and_muslim: "Bridging Christian and Muslim"
 hie_spa_and_bridging_christian_and_muslim_desc: "While these lands were often torn by war during the Reconquista, there was also much wealth to be had and much to learn from both sides. Andalusia quickly developed during the Middle Ages due to the Islamic rulers maintaining trade links with the African continent, especially tapping into the rich gold, salt, and slave trades coming from the Malian Empire. We learn these lessons from our Moorish would-be masters, and we would be foolish to reject a source of wealth merely because of religious differences."
 hie_spa_and_hacienda_system: "Hacienda System"
 hie_spa_and_hacienda_system_desc: "The old Roman Empire established the latifundia system in Iberia, whereby large plots of newly conquered land were divvied out to Roman soldiers, nobles, auxiliaries, and other eligible parties. This had the double effect of pacifying and culturally changing the region. Now, as vast tracts of land are once again recently conquered in the Reconquista and the New World, and their owners displaced, a new version of this system, incorporating the now more advanced agricultural techniques discovered in the interim, is once again in favor. The irony of this is not lost on us, of course, but neither is the lesson. With this system, the crowns grant rights to the land and the people living on that land as laborers in a plantation to any loyal citizen of the crown with the means to do so, whether through wealth, military service, or patronage by the church or a holy order. In addition, anyone who gets in debt and is unable to pay will also supply labor to these haciendas. This not only increases the number of good loyal subjects willing to venture overseas to colonize new lands but also increases the productivity of the lands as well. We see no way this could possibly have a downside."

The abundant natural harbors of southern Spain, the bridge between the Mediterranean, with all its ancient wealth, and the Atlantic, with the trade winds and the currents conspiring together to link those ports to this brand new world full of riches. The ports of Sevilla and Cadiz are then truly the most important ports in the world. Let us go onward then with full confidence that God is with us on the seas, for He has granted them to us!"

 hie_spa_and_canals_cisterns_and_towers_desc: "The old forts of Granada served their purpose well. Their intricate system of canals, cisterns, and towers lying within the fort walls created a sustainable defense against many invasions. Over time, however, the old fortresses with their high towers, squared walls, and large portcullises, have become outdated with the rise of gunpowder. However, the lessons of the past are still as relevant as ever: by creating a defense in depth and renovating the old fortifications, we can lead the continent in making forts truly unsiegable."

Strange then that no sooner had Constantinople fallen than claimants to the Byzantines began to crop up from Italy all the way to Moscow. Even the Turks themselves make the ludicrous claim that they are in fact suddenly Eastern Romans. Of course, claims through marriage or spurious territorial claims are never true claimants to the empire, but only by the time-honored Roman law can a rightful claim be maintained. So it was, that in 1502, the last surviving male relative of the fallen empire, Andreas Palaiologos, willed his title of Emperor of the Romans to the Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella. According to the law and customs of the Romans, then, we have a claim to the title, and we will never give it up until we restore what was once lost."

 hie_spa_ara_lessons_of_the_french_wars_desc: "Known to most as the “Italian Wars,” in our realm the series of struggles over the Italian peninsula became known as the French Wars, as they spilled far beyond the initial confrontation between France and Aragon over Naples. The first armed clash between French and Aragonese since the Aragonese Crusade in 1285 turned out as an unmitigated disaster for the Iberians. Neapolitan troops lacked discipline and training, and the Iberians favored light armor and weaponry to fight in the mobile warfare and open terrain of the Iberian wars of the Reconquista. These forces were smashed by the heavy French cavalry and the Swiss pikes of their mercenaries. However, our leaders showed yet again the great adaptability of the Iberian soldier, reforming the army to shine in both open terrain and close battles. In less than 10 years, our armies had been reformed into a professional and well-disciplined fighting machine capable of defeating the strongest armies in Europe."

 hie_spa_ara_the_ordinance_decrees_desc: "As part of the reforms of a new modern Spanish army, Ferdinand of Aragon passed the Grand Decrees of Ordinance in 1475. Seeing the need to surpass the hodgepodge of feudal levies, mercenaries, and retainers that supported the Reconquista, it was decreed that a census be conducted, a certain number of men be made available for service from each province and town, and that the crown would provide all with pikes “after the manner of the Swiss.” This new emphasis on direct recruitment by the crown, along with the emphasis on efficient gathering of men, is what made our success in the later French Wars possible."

It was us who first introduced the use of the stern-mounted rudder with a connection to the deck via pulleys and ropes, a substantial improvement on the steering oars of old. Of course, this was far from the only advancement made by our intrepid sailors and craftsmen, and the Basque people continue to this day to prove themselves some of the most clever sailors in the world, able to maneuver in waters that would frustrate most people."

From the fishermen who braved the North Atlantic in search of cod and whales, discovering North America long before Cabot, to the Basque explorers in official service to the Spanish crown, the Basques have proved themselves the masters of the seas time and again. From the crew of Columbus' ship to the first explorer to not only circumnavigate the world with Magellan but live to tell the tale, leave it to us to leave no stone unturned nor any island undiscovered."

However, due to the constant focus towards the south that other Iberian states took, these potential economic engines became neglected, failing to live up to their full potential. Let us look to the North once more, and harness the native talent of our northern shores."
 hie_spa_bas_royal_companies: "Royal Companies"

Because of this, our state has plenty of people willing or forced by poverty to make a new life overseas, but comparatively few resources. Our solution was to offer the wealthy few monopolios on certain colonial lands, so their private wealth combined with our royal patronage can fund all these eager would-be colonists."

Through oppression, invasion, and aggression we have managed to maintain a strong government that still respects the rights of its citizens. Let us create a broader system of Cortes where any landed citizen can bring their disputes and greivances, and have their voices heard. This has the pleasant side effect of making commerce much more active and lucrative, as well as keeping out subjects loyal."

As we have united the Spanish lands, such a ragtag fleet is no longer suitable. However, the local organizations have their uses in terms of creating a pre-existing structure to recruit sailors from all over the realm, as well as creating a rapid response framework that can act to repel hostile ships from any of our coastlands. By bringing these brotherhoods into a more uniform and controlled national body, we can ensure that our entire coastline is impervious."

Rather than training the people for naval warfare, however, it served as an army of the people, to protect the rights and freedoms of those who were not in the glimmering courts of Barcelona or Toledo.

The Battaló was the unique tax imposed on the feudal estates starting in the 17th century. By levying additional taxes on the most privileged classes of society, we were able to not only increase royal revenue, but also clamp down on the power of the estates against the government."

Some advocate that we rein in the Cortes and curtail their power. However, doing so is short-sighted, yielding short-term gains at the expense of the loyalty of the people and the estates that lead them.

This was especially true in Galicia, where even noble families were expected to make do on impossibly small lots. This excess population resulted in large waves of Galicians seeking the new lands found in the Americas. This happened so often that several colonies were referred to as additional provinces of Galicia, due to their high Galician population. Let us make these ties a reality, designating the colonies as integrated overseas provinces with all the rights and privileges thereto, rather than ruling over the distant lands as an even more distant and aloof ruler and mere collector of tribute."

Now they are more important than ever as the northern ports give key access to the Atlantic and the New World. The shipyards of the north have been neglected, and their rebuilding should be a priority for the national security of our state. This will require the establishment of new infrastructure, which we will begin immediately."

Of course, we can import timber from as far away as Norway and the Baltic Sea, but God has granted us the best possible resource here in our own lands. We sacrifice to Him, then, the great primeval forests of Spain, that their timber provide us with a worthy vessel to carry out His will."
 hie_spa_gal_asiento_system: "Asiento System"
 hie_spa_gal_asiento_system_desc: "The colonization of the Caribbean, while initially searching for gold, eventually came to rest on something far more profitable: sugar. The brutal reality of sugar cultivation and processing, however, was that it required large amounts of brutal manual labor, which neither native or European can handle. However, the important of African slaves, while expedient, is frowned on by the church and often repels the conscience of those who engage in it. Our solution is the “asiento” system, whereby the Crown grants contracts to parties outside of Spain who are less scrupulous than ourselves. These contracts grant a crown-sanctioned monopoly on the importation of African slaves to a particular Spanish colony, allowing us to reap the benefits of their labor without getting too involved in the filthy business of actually procuring it. The first of these contracts would be signed by the King in 1518, allowing Flemish and Italian merchants to access this lucrative market, while we focused on the important business of sugar."

Now, the line of the kings of old has been rediscovered in our lands. From the ashes of Asturias and Leon, a new fire has awoken, and a light from the shadows springs.

They served also as police, public gatherings, and soon became intertwined enough in the nascent holy orders of Spain to serve as gradual inductions into those orders. Because of the patronage of the orders, they grew to serve as the backbone of the Spanish army, providing large and easily tapped pools of trained recruits."

For centuries, the presumptuous Castilians sought to supplant us in everything from military might to even the use of their half-Arabized dialect. Clearly, had things continued as they were, they might well have replaced our more elegant language.

If one were to go far enough back in their history, however, one would find that nearly all of the royal and noble houses, both prominent and lesser, of the peninsula had their ultimate origin in the Kings of Leon. We trace our line to the house of Cantabria, through the great Pelayo himself, and even further back. Even Alaric the Goth, the one who overthrew the very Empire of the Ceasars itself, is present in our history. Lest we forget, that same empire of old is also present, as Alaric took for himself a Roman princess as wife, from whom all our line is descended. Truly, our crown is the crown above crowns, and the appropriate grandeur accompanies the King's court as we revive this knowledge and impress both local and foreign alike. So glorious are the many accomplishments of our house that at the very name of the king every knee present bows in sheer respect."

King Manuel I adopted the armillary sphere as the major element of the coat of arms of Portugal in the 15th century, and it was a fitting choice. It serves to remind and inspire all those who serve the Crown. It reminds us of the glorious advancements of our realm and inspires us to ever look to innovate new ways to sail and master the sea, and even reach for the stars themselves.

The system of councils was thus devised, allowing the kingdom to be governed by a comprehensive system of organization. Each region was assigned a bureaucracy to govern its local affairs more effectively, headed by a Council of Ministers who advised the King on matters of internal affairs. The first among equals and the head of all the regional councils, however, was the Royal and Supreme Council of Portugal. It alone was placed in charge of foreign affairs, diplomacy, international trade, and the military. While it took input from the regional councils, it always served the crown first, and it made for a streamlined process whereby everything from colonial affairs to local Iberian concerns was represented without becoming too much of a bureaucratic apparatus to function efficiently.

Their very strengths became their weaknesses, as their reliance on melee and boarding made them vulnerable to increasingly sophististicated and efficient small arms fire. However, their basic function can never be discarded completely, and they still can be a potent weapon if modernized. The minds of the royal court in Lisbon have successfully modified the Fusileiros to incorporate modern firearms into their ranks after the Dutch model, while still keeping the melee training that makes them effective at both land and sea warfare.

At the time of the greatest territorial expansion of the duchy they controlled a very large area south of the Po and had a quarter of a million subjects. Despite the local differences between the various centers, they adapted and simultaneously overlapped the existing territorial institutions. Towards Ferrara, in particular, they had a lot of attention, expanding it with numerous additions (the most important was the Addizione Erculea) to give it the appearance of a modern city and the dignity of a capital. Even if few of the Este lords were truly aware of the cultural implications of their government, they all grasped the political fallout deriving from the protection of the arts and letters against other dynasties. They showed great tolerance towards Jews by welcoming them from the earliest days of their presence in the city, and Ferrara became a reference point for exiles from Spain and Portugal, perhaps one of the few alternatives to Prague. And from the Jews they received enormous advantages, obtaining improvements in ducal businesses and, not infrequently, economic support for their businesses. The attitude towards the Protestants was different. During the period of Renata di Francia's stay in the city, Ferrara became a center of proselytism for the Calvinists and this could only create great difficulties with the Vatican, such as to become one of the premises for the loss of the fief."

The projects started in 1484 following the siege of Ferrara by the Republic of Venice. The first reasons were therefore essentially defensive, expanding the city area within the walls (The bulwark of the Barco is among the most archaic examples of modern fortification) but the project did not lack an urban vision linked to the concept of an ideal city and a realization of the aspirations of Hercules, linked to his training at the court of Naples, where he had learned to love classical architecture and art."

Later he knew how to always surround himself with artists and writers and made the Este court a center of European importance. In Ferrara at that time personalities such as Pietro Bembo, Ludovico Ariosto, Tiziano, Giovanni Bellini, Dosso Dossi and the sculptor Antonio Lombardo were welcomed. These masters decorated the Camerino delle Pitture and the Studio dei Marmi in the private apartment on the Via Coperta, which still today unites the castle to the ducal palace. Unfortunately the paintings and marble reliefs were dismantled and dispersed in 1598 by the papal legate after the Duchy of Ferrara passed to the Papal State. For a certain period he assigned the governorship of Garfagnana to Ariosto and personally cultivated a passion for music and architecture. Ludovico Ariosto also dedicated Orlando furioso to Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, brother of Duke Alfonso."

The first stone was symbolically laid on September 29, the day of St. Michael, the warrior archangel at the head of the celestial militias, and a date traditionally set for the removals. The work was commissioned by the Marquis Niccolò II d'Este to the architect Bartolino da Novara, former architect of the Castello Visconteo di Pavia and the Castello di San Giorgio di Mantova. The Marquis considered it essential to have a fortified structure for the defense of his court after the popular revolt which broke out in May of that same year. At the news of yet another tax increase, the Ferrarese had risen up asking for the delivery of the judge of the wise Tommaso da Tortona, adviser to the Marquis and held responsible for the taxes that weighed on the people that were actually wanted by the lord. Thomas was abandoned to his fate and, after receiving the Sacraments, he was delivered by the Marquis to the angry crowd, who literally tore him to pieces."

Azzo VI d'Este, in power until 1212, was the first lord of Ferrara, mayor of Mantua and Verona. While he was in Verona the Salinguerra chased the Este from Ferrara, then Azzo VI found himself having to fight with Salinguerra Torelli and with Ezzelino the Monk, his ally. Emperor Otto IV of Brunswick took the field in his favor and obtained a truce between the opposing forces. The emperor Otto IV, meanwhile, was excommunicated, and Azzo VI, changing his strategy, took the side of the pope, this time fighting alongside Frederick II, juggling very carefully with the alliances."

The people of Ferrara waited for a providential flood of the Po to lift the ships up to the line of fire of the guns, then ordered them to fire, destroying a large part of the fleet. The naval defeat of the Venetian Republic by a land army made a great impression on contemporaries. Alfonso I then went down in history as an artillery duke, being a technical artillery expert, a metallurgist and a cannon smelter. His artillery gained great fame in Europe, so much so that the invention of the grenade has been attributed to him. He also devised a gunpowder manufacturing system. He was also an expert in fortifications, and the walls of Ferrara, considered among the safest and most modern in Europe, were admired and celebrated by Ariosto, Michelangelo and Rabelais. Alfonso also used his firearms on the occasion of the siege of Padua by the emperor Maximilian, in 1509. His blows managed to create a breach in the city walls and the city was not conquered only because of a betrayal. The emperor nevertheless wanted to thank the Este family by investing him as lord of Este and Montagnana."

Enlistment was the responsibility of two people, generally nobles too, who had to evaluate every single man in parameters such as his value and visual ability. Each candidate had to present a guarantee to be hired, and his guarantor undertook to reimburse the Republic in case of disobedience or desertion. All the crossbowmen hired swore loyalty to the Republic and were paid directly by it, with a fixed term generally less than a year. With some frequency they were recruited from individuals belonging to the lower strata of society, often they were individuals recently immigrated to Genoa or small artisans who, without employment, abandoned, even temporarily, their usual work at the search for more luck. From the records preserved, we can thus observe that many crossbowmen were originally from Savona, from the Genoese hinterland, from Oltregiogo and Monferrato, from some places in the Po Valley (Parma, Piacenza, Pavia) and Corsica."

It was called embolus if the street was flanked by arcades where houses and warehouses were located. (Colony was exempt from local taxes); in front of the customs the Genoese scribes called 'traders' drew up the documents in the local language.

In order to pay the freight charges of the company, assumed entirely by the municipality, the consuls of 1149 transfer the income of some gabelles for 15 years, towards the advance of 1300 Genoese lire, to a company of 18 citizens, each of whom share for one part. In this financial loan operation, called purchase, the Genoese State commits a part of the ordinary income against payment of the annual fruit to a company of lending citizens called comperisti who advance the capital, obliging themselves to repay the capital within the pre-established term. Given the success, the operation was periodically repeated in the following years, growing at the beginning of the fourteenth century. The historical occasion of the constitution of the Casa delle compere e dei benchi di San Giorgio was the financial collapse of the Compagna Communis (this was the name of the medieval town of Genoa before it became a republic), caused by the harsh wars against Venice. The body was founded by a state provision with a decree of 27 April 1407 from the meeting of all the already existing "purchases", which had made loans to the State, to manage the public debt of the Compagna Communis in a unitary way. The House, Office and then Banco di San Giorgio continued to grant new loans to the Republic of Genoa. Consequently, the capital of the institute gradually increased until it reached 52 million Genoese lire."

The galleys belonged to private individuals, who made them available in case of war. Likewise, Genoa was able to gather numerous fleets in a short time, such as the 88 galleys in Meloria or the 85 in Curzola. The Republic was responsible for regulating all matters. The first rules in this regard date back to the mid-fourteenth century - the rules of Gazaria, ancient name of the Crimea - which deal precisely with the galleys used for trade with the colonies on the Black Sea. The rules of Gazaria is one of the oldest sources of maritime law in Europe. In 1559 with the peace of Cateau Cambresis, which put an end to the war between the allied Spain and France and after the battle of Lepanto (1576), the need was felt for a permanent, public fleet. He was to be under the command of regular officers, patrolling the Tyrrhenian Sea infested with Barbary pirates. The Magistrate of the Galleys was therefore established."

It also served as a criminal court over the crews and commanders of galley. Once the previous Arsenal Magistrate was suppressed, the task of ordering and following the construction of new boats was assigned to that of the Galleys. The seven constituent members of this Magistrate took the title of Provisori. They enslaved the enemies, but they worried about the fate of their fellow citizens, completely ignoring any concept of equality and the essential value of all human life. It is clear that, with those treatments, the convicts had a short life and that a continuous turnover on board the galleys was therefore necessary. In 1646 a new kind of crew was established for the galleys, no longer made up of slaves but rather of free men, regularly paid for their work. The galleys of liberty were born, driven no longer by the force of arms of the convicts, but by the work of volunteers, who will be called buonavoglia."

Bestowed directly by God, this authority is beyond challenge, permitting the ruler to operate outside earthly law.

Across the sprawling and fertile plains, where the whispering winds carried the promise of prosperity, the Gonzagas undertook the noble task of stewarding a lineage of horses that transcended mere utility, transforming into majestic symbols of strength, grace, and equestrian excellence. The intertwining legacy of the Gonzagas and their magnificent steeds echoed through the annals of history, shaping the very essence of Mantua's grandeur.

Through family wealth and a shrewd marriage policy, the Gonzagas cultivated strong ties not only with the Hohenzollerns but also with influential Italian families such as the Este, D'Avalos, Malatesta, Orsini, Medici, da Montefeltro, and Paleologo. This astute network extended beyond regional boundaries, positioning the lords of Mantua at the helm of a complex of small states stretching from Northern Italy to France and southern Italy. Meanwhile, the Este dynasty not only expanded its influence across northern Italy, forging connections with the Gonzagas, but also established a significant presence in the imperial thrones of Bavaria and Saxony. Together, these three houses—Gonzaga, Este, and Scaligeri—crafted a veritable Dynastic Triangle, strategically entwining themselves in a web of alliances and power dynamics, influencing the medieval Game of Thrones across Europe."

The Ferrara court, a European cultural hub, housed magnificent collections, including the Camerino delle Pitture and the Studio dei Marmi. Despite dispersal by the papal legate in 1598, the legacy of artistic brilliance endures. The Gonzagas, inspired by the Wunderkammer of the Bavarian Princes, created renowned art collections. Isabella d'Este, following this model, established her influential study. The Gonzaga collections set an example for European courts, showcasing their intuitive choices in contemporary art. In Mantua's golden age under Dukes Vincenzo I and Ferdinando, art thrived, and innovative inventories marked a turning point. The Scaligeri family, rulers of Verona, invested heavily in arts, architecture, and education. Verona flourished under their influence, becoming a cultural and economic powerhouse. The Scaliger era marked significant advancements in literature, music, science, and iconic landmarks like Castelvecchio and the Scaliger Tombs.

The people of Ferrara waited for a providential flood of the Po to lift the ships up to the line of fire of the guns, then ordered them to fire, destroying a large part of the fleet. The naval defeat of the Venetian Republic by a land army made a great impression on contemporaries. Alfonso I then went down in history as an artillery duke, being a technical artillery expert, a metallurgist and a cannon smelter. His artillery gained great fame in Europe, so much so that the invention of the grenade has been attributed to him. He also devised a gunpowder manufacturing system. He was also an expert in fortifications, and the walls of Ferrara, considered among the safest and most modern in Europe, were admired and celebrated by Ariosto, Michelangelo and Rabelais. Alfonso also used his firearms on the occasion of the siege of Padua by the emperor Maximilian, in 1509. His blows managed to create a breach in the city walls and the city was not conquered only because of a betrayal. The emperor nevertheless wanted to thank the Este family by investing him as lord of Este and Montagnana."

The recognition of the title of Duke by Emperor Sigismund in 1416 certifies the growing influence of the former Savoyard county and his leadership, who can now actively devote himself to domestic politics. And so Amedeo devoted himself to drafting the first body of general laws promulgated by the House of Savoy: the Sabaudiæ Statutes, also known as General Statutes, were born, and preserved in the Turin State Archives.

Sardinia was still divided into fiefs, of heterogeneous extension and jurisdiction. The owner of the fiefdom was often absent, preferably residing in the cities or outside the island. Instead of the baron, one of his officials, known as podatariu, was responsible for the collection of taxes and duties. These were numerous and often very heavy for the vassals, the inhabitants of the fiefdom. In many cases, their collection was contracted out to the so-called 'surrenders', private debt collectors who paid a fixed and previously agreed fee to the administration of the fiefdom and profited from the surplus of taxes. The imposition was therefore aggravated by this practice, with consequent protests and rebellions, in the years of famine. Then there was the problem of jurisdiction, since criminal and civil cases, at least in the first instance, were the responsibility of the lord. Taxation and the administration of justice, therefore, remained firmly in the hands of the aristocratic class."

The first Norman parliament was not deliberative, and had only a consultative and ratification function of the sovereign's activity, especially in taxation, in the economy and in the management of relations with foreign powers. The deputies were chosen from among the most powerful nobles. The first radical change took place with Frederick II of Swabia, who also allowed partial access to civil society, such as state-owned cities. Federico gathered a parliament in September 1221 in Messina known as the "Assise di Messina", where he proceeded to reorganize the legislation of the Regnum by promulgating a further nucleus of assisae, four or five, conceived to defend morality, order, and "good customs of the Kingdom", the first nucleus of those that in 1231 would have been promulgated in Melfi as Constitutionum Regni Siciliarum, then integrated into the Syracuse assembly in 1233."

In fact, they had about 25,000 biolaks of land, most of them cultivated with wheat and, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, their lands were about a tenth of the whole Mantuan dukedom. On the death of Duke Guglielmo, his colossal fortune was discovered, also consisting of two million gold coins.

Among the largest were the collections of the Popes, the Medici and the Gonzagas. Initially, they were directed towards the testimonies of the classical world, and then sculptures, bronzes, coins and medals from the Greek and Roman times. But the Princes, who became patrons, began to commission works from contemporary artists. Inspiration of the Gonzagas were the Wunderkammer of the Princes of Bavaria. In particular, Isabella d'Este looked to this model by creating her study that acquired international notoriety. The Gonzaga collections themselves became an example for the European courts, also for the proverbial intuition shown by the Gonzagas in the choice of the works of their contemporaries. Likewise, art collecting became an instrument of representation and communication in the subtle diplomatic game to which the small Mantuan state necessarily had to apply. The maximum splendor came during the government of the Dukes Vincenzo I Gonzaga and Ferdinando (son of Vincenzo I). By the will of the latter the works of art were inventoried, for the time an inventory prepared with avant-garde criteria, the usefulness of which turned out to be even greater because the diaspora of the works kept in the palaces of Mantua was about to begin."

There were three main immigration flows, from Rome, Germany and Provence. At the end of the sixteenth century, one of the largest Italian Jewish communities of the time was created in Mantua: over 3,000 people, or 7% of the city's population. At the same time Jewish families carrying out the credit activity moved to the smaller centers governed by the Gonzagas; therefore, small communities with fenerative benches, synagogues and Jewish cemeteries arose in Ostiano (Cremona), Rivarolo Mantovano, Viadana, Pomponesco, Bozzolo, Castel Goffredo."

Francesco III Gonzaga married in 1549 the niece of Charles V, Catherine of Austria, daughter of the emperor Ferdinand I and Guglielmo Gonzaga in 1561 married another daughter of the emperor, Eleonora.

 hie_mlo_piastra_milanese_desc: "Already in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries Milan was one of the most important centers in Europe for the production of weapons and armor, with over a hundred shops of armorari and gunsmiths active. The production capacity of the city was such that after the defeat of Maclodio (1427), only two families of gunsmiths were able to provide in a few days to two thousand armor for infantry and four thousand harnesses for horses for the soldiers released from Carmagnola. It is known that Gian Galeazzo Visconti in 1391 granted immunity and familiarity to the court blacksmith Simone de Correntibus that a few years earlier he had already granted to Giovanni Meravigli. However, it was in the fifteenth century that the city achieved primacy thanks to the invention of the complete armor of plates "Milanese style" (the most common along with the Gothic). It was characterized by asymmetrical shoulder straps, of greater size and thickness on the left side, where the rider was more likely to receive blows, plates that went to cover the joints that previously defended only by the underlying iron mesh, a better articulation of the pectoral, panther, flap and pouch thanks to the presence of leather straps that gave greater mobility. A further innovation was the application of a further piece that acted as a bavaria and gorget (wrapper). It was wrapped around the helmet by means of two leather laces that were fixed on the nape of the neck thanks to a washer. In addition to protecting the neck, previously often covered only by iron mail, it guaranteed greater protection to the lower half of the face, in particular from weapons insisted during enemy tournaments or cavalry charges. The Milanese plate armor was exported all over Europe; under Francesco Sforza and Galeazzo Maria Sforza they were bought by Louis XI of France and by Ludovico IX of Bavaria."

Each drew up its own statute which had to be subjected to examination and possible modifications by the Court of Provision and then approved by the duke. Once the approval of the statute was obtained, they were called universities and those that had their own representation, usually made up of consuls, elders or abbots, were called paraticians. Twenty-two are mentioned in a catalog from 1387, although their number varied over time. Even today, the names of many of these corporations survive in the Milanese street book. The statutes provided that each new master, shop owner or warehouse owner registered his trademark in a book kept by the officers of the corporation in order to defend it from competition and as a guarantee for buyers on the quality of the product. By the 15th century, most of the most important Milanese noble families engaged in some form of trade."

In 1395 Galeazzo was able to obtain the ducal title from the emperor, a dignity that placed his power on a more solid legal basis and gave him a particular authority among the Italian potentates. It was the beginning of the principality: the emperor granted the lord a feudal title and formalized the authority of the "duke", no longer subject to popular confirmation but, by imperial will, of full right and inheritance."

On that occasion an army of about 42 800 men was gathered, of which 24 700 knights (of which 2 700 men-at-arms and 22 000 of other types) divided into 140 squads and 18 000 infantrymen (3 780 heavy infantry called 'comrades' and 12 600 infantry called 'pay') divided into two armies. The first army was supposed to invade the Brescia area and was composed of about 17 400 horses divided into 100 teams in turn divided into 6 corps of 15-19 teams each and 11 800 infantry, the second was supposed to invade the Verona area and counted about 7 300 horses divided into 40 teams in turn divided into three corps of 12-14 teams each and 6 300 infantrymen.

The contribution of the water from the canal was effectively linked with the centuries-old reclamation and irrigation work of the monks of Chiaravalle, Morimondo, and the other abbeys that had operated south of Milan. The simplification of transport not only facilitated small businesses that previously took place by land but also extended their range of action and enriched the catalog, spreading well-being. The city's need for timber, for example, allowed for deforestation and the creation of new spaces for agriculture; the influx of raw materials favored the consolidation of previously sacrificed arts and crafts.

In Milan, the German traders became so numerous that a Fondaco dei Tedeschi was established. The Duchy mainly imported raw metals, raw wool, horses, saddles, pottery, crystals and saltpetre and exported weapons, armor, and agricultural products there. From France, wool and canvases were imported and armor and tapestries were exported, from Spain leather and wool, from Flanders cloths, canvases, and some fabrics, and from the Scandinavian monarchies rare leathers that cannot be found elsewhere. Credit operations were favored by the introduction of exchange letters, already in use at least since 1325 when Francesco Datini, to whom the invention is attributed, was not even born. There were sixteen Milanese trading branches in the rest of Italy and abroad. The Medici had a constant presence in Milan starting from 1455 thanks to the donation by Francesco Sforza to his friend Cosimo de 'Medici of a beautiful building in the Bossi district where a branch of the Banco Mediceo, directed by Pigello Portinari, was established; it soon became one of the most sumptuous palaces in the city. From the Republic of Venice mainly iron, gold, salt and spices were imported but occasionally also unusual animals such as elephants, lions or particular birds. Many horses were purchased from the Marquisate of Mantua, considered the best in Italy."

This relationship between the royal court and town planning had already manifested itself with Frederick II, who in the 13th century, in the Swabian statute, had concentrated the greatest attention on castles, neglecting the city walls. To the two existing castles, the Angevins added the main one, Castel Nuovo (Chastiau neuf), which was not only a fortification but above all their grandiose palace. \nThe royal residence of Naples had until then been Castel Capuano, but the ancient Norman fortress was judged inadequate for its function and the king wanted to build a new castle near the sea. \nAssigned the project to the French architect Pierre de Chaulnes, the works for the construction of the Castrum Novum began in 1279 and ended just three years later, a very short time given the construction techniques of the time and the overall size of the work. However, the king never resided there: following the revolt of the Sicilian Vespers, which cost Angioino the crown of Sicily, conquered by Peter III of Aragon, and other events, the new palace remained unused until 1285, the year of his death. by Carlo I. \nAlfonso of Aragon, who had conquered the throne of Naples in 1443, wanted to establish in the castle the function of the center of royal power and a court of magnificence that could compete with that of Lorenzo the Magnificent in Florence. The fortress was completely rebuilt in its present form. King Alfonso entrusted the renovation of the old Angevin palace-fortress to an Aragonese architect, Guillem Sagrera, a Catalan from Mallorca, who conceived it in Gothic-Catalan terms. \nThe five round towers, four of which incorporated the previous Angevin towers with a square plan, more suitable for withstanding the shots of the guns of the time, reaffirmed the defensive role of the castle. The importance of the building as a center of royal power was instead underlined by the insertion of the triumphal arch at its entrance, a masterpiece of the Neapolitan Renaissance and the work of Francesco Laurana as well as many artists of various origins."

The deputies were chosen from among the most powerful nobles. The first radical change took place with Frederick II of Swabia, who also allowed partial access to civil society, such as state-owned cities. Federico gathered a parliament in September 1221 in Messina known as the "Assise di Messina", where he proceeded to reorganize the legislation of the Regnum by promulgating a further nucleus of assisae, four or five, conceived to defend morality, order, and "good customs of the Kingdom", the first nucleus of those that in 1231 would have been promulgated in Melfi as Constitutionum Regni Siciliarum, then integrated into the Syracuse assembly in 1233."

As in Palermo, these Tuscan and Lombard artists brought the city and its surroundings to Calabria, the rich repertoire of classicist architectural decorations. However, throughout the fifteenth century, despite some obsolete interpretations, the architecture continued to follow the late Gothic tradition despite the presence of Renaissance decorative episodes. \nThe renewal of language, therefore, did not immediately involve the entire building organization. The main Sicilian architect of the fifteenth century was in fact Matteo Carnilivari who used a personal language with Gothic and Catalan elements, as in the church of Santa Maria della Catena in Palermo. His prestige as a builder was one of the obstacles to the affirmation of the Renaissance language, outside the decorative repertoire of marble workers. In addition to the few traces left by Laurana, at the end of the fifteenth century, the Renaissance language can be found only in minor episodes such as the Ventimiglia chapel in the church of San Francesco in Castelbuono."

In particular, the Spanish viceregal period (1503-1714) profoundly marked the military customs of the subsequent Bourbon period. During this time the soldiers of southern Italy were in fact involved in almost all the military events of the Spanish Empire (from the wars of Charles V to the wars of Flanders, from the colonial campaigns in America to the thirty years war), often giving proof of great value and loyalty to the imperial authorities.

To cope with this situation, our kings enacted a series of rules and provisions aimed at finally making merchant shipping in his State effective. Modern regulations were established for sailors and masters and shipbuilding and professional education were increased in the areas with the longest seafaring tradition (such as in the Sorrento peninsula and in the Campania archipelago). The new course of the Neapolitan and Sicilian merchant navy was also determined by the strengthening of the Navy and also by the elimination of customs privileges for the English, French, Spanish and Dutch woods that caused problems for the national treasury.

In addition to sowing terror among the defenseless and unprepared population, the raid yielded a substantial booty in goods but also in human lives, in fact, dozens of men and women were kidnapped to be reduced to slaves. During the next fifty years, the attacks followed with increasing intensity: the construction of the first towers and castles along the coast of Sardinia dates back to this period. \nLater also the Sardinian Giudicati, of Torres, Cagliari, Gallura, and Arborea - the forms of government of Sardinia from the eighth to the fifteenth century - and then the maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa, built numerous coastal fortifications of first defense which, at beginning of the Spanish domination, they amounted to about sixty"

The island was thus divided into four independent Giudicati both from the outside and from each other. The Giudicati were those of Torres-Logudoro, Calari, Gallura, and Arborea and were ruled by a judge (judike or zuighe in Sardinian, judex in Latin), with the power of the sovereign.

After the interruption of contacts with Constantinople during the 9th and 10th centuries, the four Sardinian judges were formed, including the Giudicato of Torres-Logudoro, with Torres own initial capital. Torres was still the second-largest center on the island politically, religiously, and by demographic size. Around 1065 on the initiative of Judge Comita the Basilica of San Gavino was built, a cathedral until 1441. Already in this period the city of Torres, like all the seaside resorts of the island, began its decline due to malaria and constant pirate raids that began to afflict the coastal cities, leading the population to retreat inland, taking refuge in places such as the nearby village of Sassari, which in this period began its rise to become the major center of the north-west by gradually ousting the ancient Turrian city. In the final stages of the Giudicato it was Sassari that became the capital (even before that there was Ardara, always chosen for the same reasons). The Giudicato ceased to exist in 1259 with Adelasia di Torres. After the dissolution of the Giudicato di Torres the city was absorbed by the free municipality of Sassari. This institution was short-lived because, with the arrival of the fleet of Alfonso IV of Aragon, the free municipality of Sassari undertook to become a vassal state of the nascent Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica commanded by the Aragonese. This subordination became official on July 4, 1323, giving way to the long Aragonese domination that shaped the city."

For many decades and at least until the age of the Restoration it was difficult for the Savoy rulers to eradicate deeply rooted customs and cultural forms, especially among the aristocratic class, but also in the rural population. In the Sardinian languages, the Iberian lexical imprints are still evident, as well as in the customs, the great religious festivals, and in many forms of socialization. In this sense, although the Spanish period is widely considered to be the darkest in the history of the island, it must be admitted that a conspicuous part of the Sardinian cultural heritage still today reveals deep bonds of affinity and sharing with that of the Iberian Peninsula."

It lasted for more than 500 years, from 900 to 1420. \nThe kingdom played a role of great importance in Sardinian history, distinguishing itself from the other judged contemporaries thanks above all to the last farsighted judges who constantly fought to reunite Sardinia under their flag. \nThe other three judges went through deep crises, suffering the interference of the maritime powers of Pisa, Genoa: it was the Arborea, allied to the kingdom of Aragon of which the judge declared himself a vassal, to determine their end and at the same time the Pisan influences in the 'island. Subsequently, it gave life to a bloody war against the kingdom of Sardinia, created by the papacy in 1297 and given to James II of Aragon, with the aim of putting an end to the struggles between Angevins and Aragonese in Sicily. \nIn the Giudicati of Arborea and Cagliari the head of state was above all called judge, in Gallura and Torres also "king"."

The cities (Cagliari, the capital, and again: Iglesias, Oristano, Bosa, Alghero, Sassari, and Castellaragonese), subtracted from the feudal regime, enjoyed wide privileges (customs, commercial, jurisdictional), depended directly on the royal administration (for this they called themselves 'royal cities') and sent their own representatives to the Cortes (parliament). In 1543 the equalization before the law of the Sardinians was formalized with the subjects of Iberian origin of the Kingdom of Sardinia. The event that sanctioned the abandonment by the Sardinians of any desire for revenge and the widespread resignation to Iberian domination. Some Sardinian intellectuals will try, over the course of the century, to emancipate the culture of the island from the condition of inferiority to which it had been relegated. Emblematic figures of this renewal were Nicolò Canelles or Canyelles, the first episcopal vicar of Cagliari and then Bishop of Bosa, who founded the first printing house in Sardinia in 1566. \nThe cultural awakening, however, was partly stifled by the action of the Spanish Inquisition, under whose jurisdiction Sardinia was subject, to impose control of Sardinian cultural life, both among the ruling class and at the popular level."

Finally, in the twenties of the century, the two universities of Sassari and Cagliari were legally redefined. For some decades the Jesuit colleges had been operating on the island, which already served as centers of study and training for Sardinian intellectuality.

Instead of the baron, one of his officials, known as podatariu, was responsible for the collection of taxes and duties. These were numerous and often very heavy for the vassals, the inhabitants of the fiefdom. In many cases, their collection was contracted out to the so-called 'surrenders', private debt collectors who paid a fixed and previously agreed fee to the administration of the fiefdom and profited from the surplus of taxes. The imposition was therefore aggravated by this practice, with consequent protests and rebellions, in the years of famine. Then there was the problem of jurisdiction, since criminal and civil cases, at least in the first instance, were the responsibility of the lord. Taxation and the administration of justice, therefore, remained firmly in the hands of the aristocratic class."

In the course of the 15th century, the bonds of subjection to the States of the Church have loosened again, thanks also to the establishment of a number of seigniories in the territory, the last of which was that of the Baglioni family. In 1531 a tax on salt was imposed on all the papal territories; this tax caused popular discontent, which the Baglioni family tried to ride out in an attempt to free themselves completely from the papal rule. Towards the end of 1539, during a period of extreme famine, Pope Paul III, during a visit to the city of Perugia, expressed his intention of requesting an increase in the price of salt (fixed price), already agreed with the municipal autonomies under the monopoly of the papal salt works, to the extent of three quattrini per pound."

The small size of the complex in the thirteenth century was proportional to the needs of the city of the time: the seasonal maintenance of a small naval team, a reserve of timber (built-in 1265) and hemp, and a deposit for tools and weapons from 1278. The first expansion of the Arsenale Vecchio took place in the years ranging from 1225 to about 1304, with the addition of an area to the east of the fortified perimeter. The palaces of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise were also built (renovated in the 15th century) which were the residences of the members of the Arsenale Regiment, the institutional body that had the task of governing and supervising the complex, consisting of three Venetian patricians who remained in office for 32 months. Later, between 1304 and about 1322, the first factory of the Corderie della Tana (Casa del Canevo) was built for the production of ropes and the Volto del Bucintoro on the Old dock.

These glass artists have always been contacted since the Renaissance to bring their skills to the courts and workshops, so much so that they became masters. In fact, for this reason, a glass school was activated in Murano that initiated young people into this profession even if the experience in the glass factory remained unique. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Murano glass was required by the highest social classes in Europe starting with the invention of crystal in about 1450; the crystal is a quality of glass that differs and that gives the glass itself some peculiar characteristics due to the same silicon base but to a higher percentage of lead oxide (24%), so the products created were particularly refined to satisfy the demand for extremely wealthy clients."

The first galleys, probably built in secret, were never used in war because they burned in the great fire of the Arsenal in 1569, but immediately after the Master Builder Francesco Bressan with some of his "Proti and Marangoni" reinforced the hull of some large galleys lying unused in the Arsenal, he mounted bow and stern castles there, reducing the oars from 50 to 48 per side, and covered them with a covered deck. Probably already in this case, all the improvements already adopted on the thin Galleys were made (such as the paddle rowing), in a short time because a war against the Ottomans was imminent and foreseen."

 hie_koj_kni_reestablishing_our_banks_desc: "The banking system of the holy orders, our system, is credited to be the birth of banking. We have laid the foundations for what will become very lucrative to traders especially those of the Italian Flemish and Dutch kind. The Templars were most famous for this practice, this system allowed pilgrims all over the Christian world to bank money and non-perishable goods. The system worked as follows: one would deposit money and or goods and a priori, they would get a proof of ownership with the amount and or goods deposited listed. The goods weren't transferable so they could sell them to the order and receive the worth of the goods as a balance, or it would be held for a pre-agreed amount of time for the owner to collect. If the owner didn't collect or came to extend his term the goods would also be forfeited. The money however was transferable for example one could deposit 500 ducats ad the priory in Paris and receive a document that proves that the order owed him 500 ducats and could collect any amount up to 500 ducats from any priory of the affiliated order. So, those 500 ducats in Paris would be able to be collected once he arrived in Rome, Jerusalem, Palermo, Nicosia, Brugge, and Aachen. As long as there was an affiliated priory they could collect. Of course when the owner fails to collect or renew the agreement after the agreed amount of time the money would be forfeited. This system once existed all over western Christendom, and it is time we bring our most lucrative business back.

With the help of the Knights Templar, he managed to not only defeat him but drive him back into Egypt, where on the way back they would lose a lot of men. Baldwin managed to win the battle not only through his military genius but by his careful study and knowledge of the terrain of the kingdom. Together with the battle, this would mean Saladin would lose 90% of his army including the prestigious and elite mamluk guard. Baldwin would however gain Saladin's mutual respect and be the only Christian he trusted, this meant that during his reign Saladin would not march an army into the kingdom out of the respect he gained for Baldwin.

 hie_fri_cross_dutchman_desc: "The famous Black Army of Pier Gerlofs Donia was the last and perhaps greatest effort by the Frisians to maintain their unique independence. Donia in particular became a semi-legendary character in Friesland, and his sudden attacks, guerilla tactics, and charisma allowed him to whip a band of disaffected mercenaries and peasants into a formidable army, and this lesson rang down through Frisian history."

In addition, the ports of Antwerp and Brugges have always been centers of trade; but through the wise investments of our merchants, have been upgraded to become the greatest ports in the world in their own right."

At age 10, children began to be trained in certain skills; the girls in domestic life or entertainment, and the boys in masonry, archery, horsemanship, and musketry. Around the age of 16, the boys that passed their training were enlisted into the army. They would marry, have children, and continue the cycle.

The three joined hands to defeat the might of Azcapotzalo in 1428 and founded the Aztec Empire as a result of this alliance. Initially, all three states were peers in the alliance but Tenochtitlan gained an increasingly dominant role in the affairs of the Empire. The Triple Alliance helped the Aztec Empire expand rapidly all over the Valley of Mexico and they subjugated dozens of tributary states."

It was not directly aimed at conquering the other city-state but was useful for other reasons. One of the main objectives was the capture of prisoners for sacrifice, surely an important side of the Aztec wars. The Tlacaelelos agreed with the chiefs Tlaxcala, Cholula, Huexotzinco, and Tliliuhquitepec to start ritual battles that would provide each of them with victims to sacrifice to the gods to ask for an end to the famine."

Their bald heads and faces were painted one-half blue and another half red or yellow. They served as imperial shock troops and took on special tasks as well as battlefield assistance roles when needed. Over six captives and dozens of other heroic deeds were required for this rank.

Great physical strength, battlefield bravery, and captured enemy soldiers were necessary to obtain this rank."
 hie_azt_travelling_merchants: "Pochteca"
 hie_azt_travelling_merchants_desc: "The pochteca occupied a high position in Aztec society, just below the nobles. The pochteca were responsible for providing materials that the nobles used to display their power. These items were often imported from foreign peoples. The pochteca traded excess tribute (food, clothing, feathers, and slaves) on behalf of the nobles at the market, or took them to other areas to exchange for trade goods. Because of the success of the pochteca, many of them became as powerful as the noble class, but they were obliged to hide this power in public. Trade expeditions often left at night, and the power of the merchants was only displayed in the guild halls. Despite being politically and economically powerful, the pochteca strove to avoid undue attention. The merchants followed their own laws in their trampling, worshipping their god, Yacatecuhtli, "The Lord Who Guides", one of the representations of Quetzalcoatl. Eventually, the merchants were elevated to the rank of warriors in the military orders."

Tlatocayotl, or the principle of rulership, established that descent inherited this divine right. A political order was, therefore, also a cosmic order, and to kill a tlatoani was to transgress that order. For this reason, whenever the Nahuas killed or otherwise removed a tlatoani from their station, their stead typically placed a relative and member of the same bloodline. The establishment of the office of Huetlatoani understood through the creation of another level of rulership, hueitlatocayotl, standing in superior contrast to the lesser tlatocayotl principle."

Initially formed from the Safaviyya Sufi order headed by Shayk Haydar, the group rose to prominence from its connections with other secret societies like the Khurramites and Turko-Shamanism. From then, it expanded greatly among the Turks and Tajiks, helping Shah Ismail I conquer the Aq Qoyunlu tribe across the Tigris and Eastern Persia. For the most part, their loyalty and militarism established a strong Shiite state that, while intolerant of most other Muslims, carved out and independent Persia that survived both Colonialism and Revolution."

 hie_per_caravanserais_desc: "Under the governance of the strong shahs, especially during the first half of the 17th century, traveling through Iran was easy because of good roads and the caravanserais, that were strategically placed along the route. Iranian caravanserais were better built and cleaner than their Turkish counterparts. Caravanserais were designed especially to benefit poorer travelers, as they could stay there for as long as they wished, without payment for lodging. During the reign of Shah Abbas I, as he tried to upgrade the Silk Road to improve the commercial prosperity of the Empire, an abundance of caravanserais, bridges, bazaars, and roads were built, and this strategy was followed by wealthy merchants who also profited from the increase in trade. To uphold the standard, another source of revenue was needed, and road tolls, that were collected by guards (rah-dars), were stationed along the trading routes."

The qollar-aghasi, the qurchi-bashi, and the tofangchi-aghasi were notable members of the military branch, yet the focus of administration was centered around checks and balances. The highest level in the government was that of the Prime Minister, or Grand Vizier (Etemad-e Dowlat), who was always chosen from among doctors of the law. He enjoyed tremendous power and control over national affairs as he was the immediate deputy of the Shah. No act of the Shah was valid without the counter seal of the Prime Minister. But even he stood accountable to a deputy, who kept records of his decision-makings and notified the Shah. Second to the Prime Minister's post were the General of the Revenues (mostoufi-ye mamalek), or finance minister, and the Divanbegi, Minister of Justice. n 16th and 17th century Iran, there existed a considerable number of local democratic institutions. Examples of such were the trade and artisan guilds, which had started to appear in Iran in the 1500s. Also, there were the quazi-religious fraternities called futuvva, which were run by local dervishes.

Persian carpets and rugs were initially woven as articles of necessity to cover the floors of nomadic tribesmen, giving them protection from the cold and damp. The natural progression of the skill and craft involved in the creation of these works of art has been passed down from generation to generation over the centuries throughout periods of peace, invasion, and war. As international trade developed, the variety of patterns and designs grew. The Persian carpet reached its zenith during the reign of the Safavid Dynasty, when Shah Abbas encouraged contacts and trade with Europe and transformed his new capital, Isfahan, into one of the most glorious cities of Persia. He also built workshops for carpets where skilled designers and craftsmen set to work to create splendid specimens. Most of these carpets were made of silk, with gold and silver threads adding even more embellishment."

Unlike European muskets, however, the jazayer was loaded using a horn rather than a paper cartridge meaning although the jazayer had the advantages of range, the force of impact, and accuracy, it took longer to reload than the standard European muskets of the era. One of the earliest recordings of Persian soldiers using jazayers in combat dates back to the mid-seventeenth century."

The Savaran-e Sepah-e Khorasan played a decisive role in the final phase of the battle of Kars in which they participated in a huge flank attack, (40,000 strong), which Nader led personally."

 hie_per_jazayerchi_tofangchi_desc: "Afsharid infantry was split into two armies. The Tofangchi was the regular corps of musketeers, while the Jazayerchi were the elite gunners of Nader's personal army. During his reign, the importance of infantry began to be realized in Persian Armies, whereas they previously were second to the cavalry. Jazayerchi units engaged in training for several hours every day. A clear emphasis was given to the constant drilling of the soldiers. Nader shaped the jazayerchi corps himself and often took personal command of them in battle. According to another contemporary, the jazayerchi were well-uniformed and provided with the best equipment. Although the Jazayerchi was an infantry corps they usually campaigned on mounts and occasionally fought as mounted troops also. They were used to achieve the hardest and most crucial tactical tasks due to their high quality as elite fighting troops, proving their worth in many battles including Mihmandust, Murche-Khort, Kirkuk, Yeghevard, Karnal and Kars."

 hie_dan_kalmar_union_desc: "Despite the obvious cracks forming in the Kalmar union, Danish authority is maintained by the King's realm. A great effort may be required, and rebellions must be endured, but the state is sure to retain the union of the Scandinavian countries, and possibly even centralize them."
 hie_dan_sound_toll: "Øresundstolden"
 hie_dan_sound_toll_desc: "The Sound Toll remains the lifeblood of the imperial treasury, and since 1429 when Erik of Pomerania introduced the Øresundstolden, a major trade apparatus that allows Denmark to manipulate the Baltic. Even the mighty Hansa has been subjected to the customs. As the custodian of one of the main roads of the older European maritime trade, we continue to reap the benefits of controlling such straits."
 hie_dan_royal_waters: "Kongens Strømme"

 hie_dan_folk_church_desc: "Religion in Denmark has been predominantly Christian since the 9th century. However, it's allegiance to Rome hasn't been the strongest, since it joined the reformation fairly quickly after it started. It was governed by The People's Church, and has had a strong connection to the Danish people, while retaining elements of Lutheranism and Catholicism."
 hie_dan_stavnsband: "Stavnsbånd"
 hie_dan_stavnsband_desc: "Serfdom is ingrained into Danish society like many places in Europe, and its abolishment in 1702 was well received by the population, but its removal became challenged when many peasants began flocking to the cities, depleting the nobles of workforce and conscripts. As a result, Stavnsbånd was introduced, which tied men between 18-36 to the estate they were born on, but could buy themselves a way out."
 hie_dan_sokadetakademie: "Søkadetakademiet"
 hie_dan_sokadetakademie_desc: "Denmark lacks the competency in Søværnet, seen in places like England, Venice, and Portugal. Our admirals simply don't innovate and the navy itself is woefully underequipped. Therefore we require an officers school to educate those who heed our ships."
 hie_dan_danish_law: "Danske Lov"
 hie_dan_danish_law_desc: "The Danish Code is first and foremost based on earlier Danish legislative work. Roman law rarely applies to the book. The enactment of the Danish law is a milestone in the history of law in Denmark and even in Northern Europe, marking the beginning of the evolution of the Danish legal system from medieval law to a modern legal system. The problem that plagued Danish economic development and centralization was resolved."

Therefore, our defensive strategy revolves around fortifying the area around the Neva and concentrating forces there, as the cold winter and north prevent any sane general from flanking us."
 hie_fin_saunas: "Saunas"
 hie_fin_saunas_desc: "Saunas are an integral part of the way of life in Finland. In Finland, when people move, the first thing they do is build a sauna. Finns use the sauna to live in, eat, address matters of hygiene, and, most importantly, give birth in an almost sterile environment. The availability of wood needed to build and warm the sauna has never been an issue. Saunas are possibly the most Finnish custom to exist."
 hie_fin_free_peasants: "Free Yeomen"
 hie_fin_free_peasants_desc: "Serfdom in Finland does not exist, and peasants are freemen who own small plots of land, even under the Swedish Empire. In Finland the peasants formed one of the four estates and were represented in the parliament. Outside the political sphere, however, the peasants were considered at the bottom of the social order—just above vagabonds. Still, many peasants had relatively good lives compared to the rest of Europe, and the peasants were not passive either. They were proud of their traditions and would band together and fight to uphold their traditional rights in the face of burdensome taxes from the king or new demands by the landowning nobility."

The first dissertation of the Academy was Discursus politicus de prudentia, prepared by Professor Wexionius and examined on 18 December 1641. It also became the first book printed in Finland when the printing of dissertations began in Turku the following year. Since then, the tradition of promotion has continued uninterrupted at the Imperial Alexander University and the University of Helsinki, and later at other Finnish universities throughout university history."
 hie_fin_ruotujakolaitos: "Ruotujakolaitos"
 hie_fin_ruotujakolaitos_desc: "Like Sweden, Finland also benefited from the allotment system, especially since Finnish troops made up a significant part of the military. Finland was seen as part of Sweden Proper, and thus gained its reforms. Each province was required to provide 1,200 men for the army, which was maintained by constant reductions that increased the land available to the state."

 hie_fin_sisu_desc: "Sisu is extraordinary determination in the face of extreme adversity, and courage that is presented typically in situations where success is unlikely.

But the west is a great and undefined place. That's why we ever went onward. Either by those who had no choice to leave home and look for a new place to call home those seeking wealth or those driven mad by the idea of the unknown. Our ancestors established new viking lands like Iceland and like the now mythical Greenland and Vinland. These now lost lands have always been remembered now after centuries of infighting among the northern kingdoms we have regained some form of stability thanks to the kalmar union. And this stability has invoked a rekindling of interest in these norse lands and that we might reconnect with our brethren."

 hie_nor_the_legacy_of_harfagri_desc: "Harald Fairhair was first king of Norger, the kingdom of the norse. Norger benign our ancient name and us being the last kingdom of the northern brothers to unite. This might seem like a banality but the Norse have always been a divided and unruly people. Yet he managed to establish and maintain a functional government and a united people who would prove near mythically undefeatable in the coming centuries. This is the legacy of the first king of Norway managing to bring stability where it seemed there was none. Managing to bring unity where it seemed there was none. Lastly managing to turn his people themselves into one of the most effective weapons of the middle ages."

 hie_nor_the_sagas_desc: "The sagas are more than just some nice stories. For centuries these stories have governed and inspired our culture and our people to always surpass themselves. To carve out their own path in the waves of history. In fact many of the original sagas have inspired great men and women to take action and who have since had sagas written about them. For example the saga of Harald hardrada or Rurik the great and Rollo of normandy. The system of sagas as long as they work is a perpetual cycle in our society to push our people beyond their own perceived capabilities and to reach beyond. The eternal saga is our goal: a perpetual global Norwegian golden age. "
 hie_nor_true_but_misunderstood: "True But Misunderstood"
 hie_nor_true_but_misunderstood_desc: "It is true our ancestors were raiders and rather barbaric ones too. But we were also largely misunderstood. Our people were mainly traders, artisans and farmers, the reason for our raids were due to the harsh winter. The raid's main goal was to gather resources to overcome this winter to sustain ourselves and where seasonal. For most of the year we traded, crafted and farmed. This however made us a very versatile people, our people have become natural sailors, professional soldiers, extremely good carpenters and shipbuilders and creative farmers. We were portrayed as the boogeymen europe. But if you care to take a closer look we are just extremely versatile people doing everything in their power to survive and thrive in our homeland."
 hie_nor_modernization_of_society: "Modernization Of Society"
 hie_nor_modernization_of_society_desc: "The one thing our society has lacked is modernity. It took centuries to reach the point most of Europe was in the middle ages. This changed due to two factors, one being unity that we finally became able to even among our own people we could share ideas and advancements. Secondly, our conversion to christianity opened us up to the rest of europe diplomatically. With us no longer being branded as heathens, the other christians states were finally comfortable sharing in their ideas and innovations. Our need for priests and monks also brought a wide set of intellectual and learned minds from all over Europe eagerly wanting to establish a central church within Norway. This gave birth to many institutions of education and learning within Norway, laying the foundation for most if not all of our universities."
 hie_nor_hanseatic_colonies: "Hanseatic Colonies"
 hie_nor_hanseatic_colonies_desc: "The irony of the establishment of Hansa cities in our land doesn't go past us. The hanseatic league was founded as an alliance between traders to stand strong against robbers on the road and vikings on the sea. This made it downright ironic when in the late 13th century Bergen was declared a Kontor of the Hanseatic league. A Kontor or major trading post was the administrative center of many smaller trading posts in the region. Bergen controlled over twenty smaller trading posts along the Norwegian coast connecting us intimately to the European trade network and allowed us to strengthen our trade influences, for example strengthening our western trade routes and creating one of the strongest and safest routes to the new world.

The head of state is thus a bastion of Swedish independence, and its representation of the needs of the nobility means that any monarch will forever be legitimate in the eyes of the people"
 hie_swe_reformation: "Liturgiska Striden"
 hie_swe_reformation_desc: "The Liturgical Struggle has been caused by centuries of distance from Rome and the growing power of the state over the church. Catholicism seemed too friendly to the Danish, as seen by the actions of Gustav Trolle, and the seizure of church land increasingly swayed Sweden to Protestantism. The struggle saw development into the idea of Swedishness, and allowed peasants, who were already well represented, to learn and read the bible."
 hie_swe_instrument_of_government: "Regeringsformen"
 hie_swe_instrument_of_government_desc: "The state is an apparatus that has been molded over the centuries. In 1634 the first Instrument of Government, engineered by Axel Oxensternia, is seen as Sweden's first collection of national laws, and the constitution would come in the following centuries. The instrument consolidated Stockholm's role as an administrative center and capital, where the royal house, government, and parliament gathered in the city to convene on matters."
 hie_swe_go_to: "Gå-På!"
 hie_swe_go_to_desc: "The military of Sweden uses the phrase 'go to' to denote when they charge. The military often used aggressive shock tactics, contrasting the increasingly stationary and musket-based armies of continental Europe. It developed during the Carolean period and saw numerous successes in the thirty years' war, partly due to the Finnish Hakkapeliitta, and the Northern Wars, particularly Narva. Due to the strict discipline of Sweden's small army, the Gå-På worked well, and Sweden's soldiers were the bane of anyone who crossed them."
 hie_swe_indelningsverket: "Indelningsverket"
 hie_swe_indelningsverket_desc: "Swedish allotments are divided into two kinds: the Old and New. The Old system came from the 1634 Instrument and was maintained in the provinces. Recruitment took place through discharge ordered by the king. All common men between the ages of 15 and 50 were gathered at the place of discharge in each district. Meanwhile, the New system happened after the Skanian war and used rotations to ensure that men were always ready for the army. Each province was required to provide 1,200 men for the army. This was maintained by constant reductions that increased the land available to the state."
 hie_swe_caroleans: "Caroleans"
 hie_swe_caroleans_desc: "Sweden is small and does not have resources like France or Russia. Thus the army needs to innovate. Good discipline is vital for the Carolean's highly aggressive tactics, which required them to keep in formation and hold their fire as they approached the enemy, even if coming under a hail of bullets themselves. Carolean fight not just for the king, but for god itself, as they believe they are crusading against heretics and heathens. In fact, fatalism is induced to ensure soldiers have no fear, since if God wanted them to survive then nothing could harm them, and conversely if He had decreed that they were to die then death would come even if they tried to flee. On a more practical level, the army enforced draconian codes of discipline in order to encourage immediate and unthinking obedience among the men."

If the challenger loses the general stays in charge if they don't it is customary to spare the general a death of old age and give him a glorious death in honourable combat. Now honorary combat is important here there must always be 3 witnesses present who do not know each other directly and confirm it is honorary combat.

These majestic ruins were a place where we taught our children the way of our people. We would educate them, help them train for combat and study the ancient art of our people. The ruins showcase a very large ruined walled-in city. At its heart, a majestic stepwell cistern covered in hundreds of pillars and ancient hieroglyphic inscriptions in the ancient lost language of our ancestors.

Turning us slowly over time into a Rajput society, one that promotes its people on martial merit.

They had no problem drawing the sword when necessary however they did so with skill in strategy and unbridled bravery. Their long-established system of subjects and connections would all but dissolve with the arrival of Bedouin conquers in the Indus Valley.

While both faiths were generally tolerant of one another the difference wasn't all that felt within the lower class. This conflict would however show itself in the monarchy. Becoming a back-and-forth between the Muslim part and the Hindu part of the dynasty to gain as much power as possible or do everything to one-up each other. If one funded a temple the other had to build a bigger more majestic mosque, rival palaces, courts, and even ministers and political positions.

As the strongest of the gods, we believe him the only one worthy of veneration, the god who can destroy the universe is one to keep as close as possible.

Having sparked our interest we would invite many European traders to form a foreign quarter within our state. Mainly attracting traders, explorers and simply interested people from Europe. It is from this pool of people that we would employ some of our best advisors and even ministers from time to time.

These men were highly proficient in both making it a career to specialise in their weapon craft. This backbone was then supported by the highly capable Marwari cavalry which was an extremely light cavalry who would specialise in the cover of flanks and flanking itself. They were followed by a siege elephant core which were heavily armoured elephants with a small swivel cannon and archers mounted in a pagoda on top of the elephant supported by archers. These would be closely followed by heavy camel cavalry which had a two-man team; the front man was heavily armoured with a spear and heavy shield while the man in the back was equipped with a heavy rifle, strong enough to kill an elephant.

This lack of leadership was perhaps the most decisive factor in the Rajputs’ most spectacular defeats over the centuries.Competing egos and the need to satisfy the caste system meant that uniting the Rajputs under one strong leader was almost impossible. However, it was in Mewar that, despite all obstacles, a succession of strong leaders came to power that could unite the unruly Rajputs into a single cohesive Confederacy of India’s proudest warriors. Unity, once imposed on these fighting men, has produced incredible results, as Mewar is now able to field large armies of professional soldiers. Truly, as with any push towards unity, we have shown the world that together, we are stronger than the sum of our parts. Long have we lost ground to the Muslim invaders, whose strength lies in their unity. No longer! We shall show them that when we fight side-by-side, we stand tall and none can tear us down."

 hie_mer_masters_of_intelligence_desc: "While our armies would leave our enemies in awe and defeated. What they didn't see was the vast amount of preparation it took on our part to get there. The reason we won battles was not only due to the skill of our men or the composition of our army and how we used them. No, the main reason we won wars was preparation, scouts and spies formed the most important aspects of our planning. We would scout out preferred battlefields that favoured our fighting style, goading them into confronting us at a battlefield of our choosing. Our scouts were also very important for the finding of water sources for our encampments making sure our armies would suffer as little attrition as possible. The same went for localising food sources and even medical care. Supporting this would be our spies which we would send before invasions or attacks. Trying to turn the local police against their soldiers performing sabotage on supply lines. But most important of all the thing that would win us wars, not battles, is information. Who is leading the army, how many what type, how many of what type their supply lines or their lack of weaknesses and their strength? Even down to the favourite food of the leaders of our enemies. Soldiers win battles, information wins wars. To defeat one's enemy you first must know and understand the set enemy on an intimate level."

 hie_mew_the_khanzadas_desc: "They are originally from a rather unknown Rajput clan that now no longer exists. The Khanzadas are a rare example of a Rajput clan and dynasty that converted to Islam. Since Rajput culture and tradition are so intertwined with the Vedic faith, breaking this link can be quite culturally and diplomatically alienating. Despite all of this they persisted in the name of their faith while they enjoyed an awkward tolerance among the Rajputs they remained outcasts among their people. This drove them to employ a sort of state-enforced isolationism. Rejection of immigrants, traders can only enter with very strict rules and have to acquire permits to do business in any town here. Mewat would become 100% self-sustaining and closed off from the rest of the world as much as realistically possible."

Those who have been allowed to travel to our rather kept secret capital due to our policy of isolationism. Having said that, it feels like stepping back in time to a place where the tradition of old has been safeguarded. A time capsule of what Rajputana used to be long before any outside involvement, disregarding the mosques and small Islamic minority, that is.

While Muslims maintain ceremonies that in their eyes don't violate their faith, like Holi or Diwali. While seeing them for what they are, they are loose from their religious context as an important part of their culture, so they celebrate not as Muslims but as the children of Bharat. While the Hindus let the Muslims celebrate their holidays and maintain respect during Ramadan. They have also moved into separate parts of the cities, creating a Muslim and Hindu quarter. While maintaining the places of trade and cultural entertainment unified. This would allow our people to keep the uncompromisable parts of their faith separated while maintaining the same cultural and economic identity."

It brings us the things we can not produce ourselves like weapons, metals, and spices. This road spans the length of South Asia running from Tabriz to Bengal. Only a select number of traders are allowed to stop within our cities. However weird as it sounds, this had some very beneficial effects on trade. Due to the fact only a select number of traders were allowed to trade with our artisans, our products are extremely rare beyond our borders. Things like our unique style of pottery and carpentry were very wanted among the princes of Persia and western India. Creating a far greater demand than a handful of traders could even carry out of our kingdom on their caravans. Making our product somewhat of an unintended luxury abroad. This means we can sell these products at a very high premium boosting our economy and making otherwise marginalised professions like carpentry and potter's rise to the top of the social ladder."

These first are purposefully isolated and hard to find intended to weather storms for a long time, then launch any form of resistance from it.

To gauge what needs to be done in times of disasters like war disease or storms. This is why we established the ministry of stewardship and instituted the universal census. This census was tasked with categorising everything from every child man and woman to the number of trees and what type of trees and their use. The amount of people working certain professions, the amount of harvested produce each year. Money pottery carpentry bricks. Everything that could be stockpiled and counted would be.

On top of these horses, a rajput noble, each dressed to impress in their clan and house colours, dressed with their most elaborate courtly weapons, made especially for such occasions.

We would formalise them in a bit to have the first effective standing army in India with men who make their living solely of being soldiers for a state. The formalisation of these mercenaries would turn out to be highly lucrative for them, having stable pay and access to weapons would attract them in large numbers. While on the other hand we would get a standing army that is already trained and comfortable in the use of gunpowder weapons with the skills to maintain their weapons and how to use them to deadly effect.

Money wasn't an issue, because everyone needs food, however we couldn't produce a lot of things ourselves, such as weapons, dyes, or anything else that could be grown or made out of sand and rock. This forced us to use our wealth and food to trade for everything else we needed. Thus, we became quite good at it for without trade our society would default back to a strictly agrarian society with barter economy."
 hie_ptl_the_secret_to_silk: "The Secret To Silk"
 hie_ptl_the_secret_to_silk_desc: "We are the oldest region outside of China to cultivate and know the secrets of silk farming and production. Wherever it arrives it is always kept as a very closely guarded secret, with the stealing of silk worms being punishable by the generational death penalty. This means that your parents, your wife and your children would be condemned to death alongside you. The silk production in the region dates back to the reign of Ashoka the Great which was long before the arrival of the ones that go by the name of the Hellenic. The great emperor Ashoka made a deal with the then Han dynasty that we would trade our spices exclusively with them while they would allow us to produce silk. Officers of the Han imperial court came to survey the lands of Ashoka and stumbled upon our homeland. According to the Chinese officials, it was the only location with the right climate to sustain silkworm production. It has to be said that being gifted silkworms by the Chinese court and letting them die would be a far graver insult than spitting on the emperor, for example. It is so that for the past twelve hundred year we were the only region in all of India that produced silk, and for half that time the only other place in the world that produced silk."

 hie_ptl_sword_dancers_desc: "The cultural practice of sword dancing isn't just an expression of art and culture. It is actually the beautification of the natural sword fighting style. The dualists from Kathiawar were known for their elegant form, agility, dexterity and almost rhythmic movements during sword fighting. The style became especially popular with the nobility and a discipline within the military. This made a close quarters clash with our troops a deadly affair often confusing the opponent and swing them in hand to hand combat. Some of our enemies even referenced it as the most beautiful way to die in utter awe of the beauty and form of your opponents fighting style. While the practice lost some of its esteem with the rise of gunpowder weapons it is still maintained in combat by nobility and the elite warrior cast known by the same name as sword dancers who specialised in urban combat where the use of gunpowder weapons is extremely limited."

Sweet rice with spices, tea and or coffee would be the way to welcome one's guest among the nobility. While in the rest of India this would be the nobility in our lands this is the great equaliser however. No matter the caste or class iddada will be ready and presented. The fact that even the lowest of the low present this to guests gives an allure of esteemed hospitality to our society. We have become known as the land where hospitality reigns supreme."

Now that we have brought stability back to the region our people have started to flock back to their home land. Bringing their new languages experiences and expertise back with them they have built up over the centuries. Bringin not only their generational trade experiences, new ideas, customs and products. They are also mending centuries old emotional scars remnant from the trauma of being forced to abandon their heritage."
