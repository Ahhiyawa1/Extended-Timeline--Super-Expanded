bookmark_sack_of_rome_event.EVTDESC1:0 "The eternal city of Rome has been sacked by the vile barbarians of the Visigoths! We have not faced such humilition in eight hundred years since the days of the early Republic. Even now, the Visigoth forces continue to ravage southern Italia. If we neglect to take action now, our great empire may be in danger of collapse at the hands of these barbarians. Truly, Rome has never been more vulnerable!"

bookmark_flavortown_events.EVTNAME2:0 "The Return of Napoléon"
bookmark_flavortown_events.EVTDESC2:0 "The former emperor Napoléon escaped from his exile in Elba and has arrived in Paris. Along the way, he had been warmly received by many and, initially numbering only a few men, his supporters had grown into and army by the time of his arrival in Paris. Perhaps this is a sign that the Empire is destined to rule over Europe once more."

bookmark_flavortown_events.EVTDESC3:0 "The former emperor Napoléon escaped from his exile in Elba and has arrived in Paris. Along the way, he had been warmly received by many and, initially numbering only a few men, his supporters had grown into and army by the time of his arrival in Paris. This sudden development certainly bodes poorly for the peace of Europe."

bookmark_flavortown_events.5.desc:0 "As the first and only sole-ruling Empress in Chinese history - a female ruler ruling not on behalf of a consort or son but in her own right - Empress Wu Zetian has declared the beginning of her own dynasty, a separate lineage from the Tang.\n\nClaiming descendance from the ancient Zhou dynasty of old, the same Zhou that followed the Shang and preceded the Spring and Autumn Period, Empress Wu Zetian declares the beginning of a new Zhou dynasty. Thus, the Empress has the authority to the end of the Tang and the establishment of a reborn Zhou dynasty in China."
bookmark_flavortown_events.5.a:0 "Declare the rebirth of the Zhou dynasty!"
bookmark_flavortown_events.5.b:0 "We are successors of the Tang, no more and no less."
