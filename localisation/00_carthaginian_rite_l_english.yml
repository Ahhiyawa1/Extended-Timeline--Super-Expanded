 carthaginian_rite_desc:0 "The Carthaginian Rite is a unique Afro-Roman Western Chalcedonian tradition that blends orthodox Christian doctrines with local customs and cultural influences native to North Africa. It emerged as a way for North African Christians to preserve their distinct identity while remaining in communion with the broader Chalcedonian Church. Emphasizing both faith and cultural harmony, the Carthaginian Rite fosters tolerance and respects local traditions, creating a shared Christian experience that enriches the religious diversity of the region."
