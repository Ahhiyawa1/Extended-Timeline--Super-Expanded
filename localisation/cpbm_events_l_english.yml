 #History
 cpbm_history_africa.1.t: "Rise of the Idrisids"
 cpbm_history_africa.1.d: "The founder of the dynasty, Idris ibn Abdallah, traces his ancestry back to Ali ibn Abi Talib and his wife Fatimah, daughter of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. After the Battle of Fakhkh, near Mecca, between the Abbasids and supporters of the descendants of the prophet Muhammad, Idris ibn Abdallah fled to the Maghreb. He has arrived in Tangier, the most important city of Morocco, and by now he has settled in Volubilis. It is up to us whether his story simply ends here."
 cpbm_history_africa.1.a: "Dispose of the Pretender at once!"
 cpbm_history_africa.1.b: "Only Idris can hope to rival the eastern Caliphate."
 cpbm_history_africa.1.c: "In the name of Allah, these unbelievers will learn to fear the name of $MONARCH$!"
 cpbm_history_africa.2.t: "Colonisation of Western Sahara"
 cpbm_history_africa.2.d: "Our influence has expanded further along the coast of the Sahara Desert."
 cpbm_history_africa.2.a: "But... I don't have any colonists?"
 cpbm_history_africa.3.t: "Rise of the Hintata"
 cpbm_history_africa.3.d: "The Hintata are a Berber tribal confederation of the High Atlas. Though they maintain loyalty to us by rendering their political and fiscal services, some of our advisors have expressed concern at their rising regional power and the danger that presents to our rule over the area."
 cpbm_history_africa.3.a: "They are useful to us and present no danger. Live and let live"
 cpbm_history_africa.3.b: "The concern is justified. We must restrict their autonomy"
 cpbm_history_africa.3.c: "Round up their leaders. A few public executions will do wonders"
 cpbm_history_africa.4.t: "The Hintata Reach Marrakesh"
 cpbm_history_africa.4.d: "The Hintata tribes of the Atlas have spread out and are now settling in and around Marrakesh. This will undoubtedly have an impact on our nation."
 cpbm_history_africa.4.a: "They remain loyal to us, so I don't see the problem."
 cpbm_history_africa.4.b: "They can stay, but must appoint different governors for their regions."
 cpbm_history_africa.4.c: "Unacceptable!"
 cpbm_history_africa.4.dd: "Freedom of movement! Let's send our best and most loyal to their regions also"
 cpbm_history_africa.4.e: "We have bigger fish to fry right now, and no capacity to deal with this."
 cpbm_history_africa.5.t: "Khawarij Spreads in the Maghreb"
 cpbm_history_africa.5.d: "The Kharijite faith has found adherents in a new land. Through preachers, a province has converted and become majority Kharijite."
 cpbm_history_africa.5.a: "We can't stop the spread of faith."
 cpbm_history_africa.5.b: "Perhaps they may be onto something..."
 cpbm_history_africa.6.t: "Berber Revolt"
 cpbm_history_africa.6.d: "Spurred on by puritanical Kharijite agitators, the native Berber population have revolted against the ruling Caliphate. The rebellion began among the Berber tribes of western Morocco, and spread quickly across the region, posing a direct challenge to our control over the area."
 cpbm_history_africa.6.a: "We are clearly at a disadvantage, perhaps they will be swayed with greater autonomy..."
 cpbm_history_africa.6.b: "...or a huge bribe..."
 cpbm_history_africa.6.c: "...a bribe to us, that is..."
 cpbm_history_africa.6.dd: "...but then again, they are heretics!"
 cpbm_history_africa.6.e: "And there will be NO mercy!"
 cpbm_history_africa.7.t: "Viking Raid of Nekor"
 cpbm_history_africa.7.d: "We have become subject to a 62 ship-strong group of Vikings, who have already defeated our local garrison in Nekor as we attempted to interfere with their plundering of the area."
 cpbm_history_africa.7.a: "We can't just let them raid without any resistance."
 cpbm_history_africa.7.b: "With God on our side, we will fight them to the last man!"
 cpbm_history_africa.7.c: "Sad. Anyway, I must get ready for the banquet this evening."
 cpbm_history_africa.8.t: "Rise of the Almoravids"
 cpbm_history_africa.8.d: "Abdallah ibn Yasin is a theologian, founder, and first leader of the Almoravid movement and dynasty with origins in the Yazulah tribe from the Sus. He advocates an orthodox interpretation of Sunni Islam and has united a number of tribes with himself as spiritual leader."
 cpbm_history_africa.8.a: "Off with his head!"
 cpbm_history_africa.8.b: "Ok... so what? What could this man possibly do to my Kingdom?"
 cpbm_history_africa.8.c: "We have no choice but to negotiate"
 cpbm_history_africa.9.t: "Rise of the Almohads"
 cpbm_history_africa.9.d: "The Almohad movement has begun with Ibn Tumart, a member of the Masmuda, a Berber tribal confederation of the Atlas Mountains of southern Morocco. After his recent return to the Maghreb, Ibn Tumart has been spending time in various Ifriqiyan cities, preaching and agitating, heading riotous attacks on wine-shops and on other manifestations of laxity. He lays the blame for the latitude on our ruling dynasty, whom he accuses of obscurantism and impiety."
 cpbm_history_africa.9.a: "This is such a boring conversation. Fetch me more wine"
 cpbm_history_africa.9.b: "Seize the traitor!"
 cpbm_history_africa.9.c: "We are in no shape to combat this movement"
 cpbm_history_africa.9.dd: "We must fight to protect the interests of our loyal subjects"
 cpbm_history_africa.10.t: "Rise of the Marinids"
 cpbm_history_africa.10.d: "The Marinids, hailing after the berber Banu Marin tribe, have begun to present more and more of a real threat to our nation. Years of sporadic fighting have culminated to this moment. Despite handing them multiple defeats in the past, the Marinids have embarked on a more deliberate campaign of conquest."
 cpbm_history_africa.10.a: "I don't care about those Marinids, we already know how weak they are"
 cpbm_history_africa.10.b: "Call up our allies to help protect our territorial integrity!"
 cpbm_history_africa.10.c: "Their campaign stops here!"
 cpbm_history_africa.10.dd: "We are in no shape to combat this movement"
 cpbm_history_africa.10.e: "We must fight to protect the interests of our loyal subjects"
 cpbm_history_africa.10.f: "We can handle this without assistance"
 cpbm_history_africa.11.t: "Moroccan Succession Crisis"
 cpbm_history_africa.11.d: "Our Sultan has been assassinated! After decades of our dynasty waning, other dynasties are rising and posing a serious challenge to our authority. Perhaps it's too late to salvage this.. only time will tell who will ultimately succeed as the next Moroccan Sultan."
