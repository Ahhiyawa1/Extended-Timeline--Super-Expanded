As a consequence, rice has become extremely popular. Prices climbed, and Asian rice producing countries saw their income increasing significantly."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT16:0 "Ok."
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME17:0 "Imperial Pearls"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC17:0 "Pearls have been used in jewelry since ancient times. At the time, they were called Aphrodite's tears. Overtime, Europeans became overwhelmed by the beauty and perfection of these gems. Pearls became a symbol of purity, but also luxury. Every king and emperor wanted to get a necklace or a crown set with pearls. Their goal was to have jewels so beautiful that they would make their rivals green with envy."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT17:0 "Ok."
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME18:0 "Pearl Mass Breeding"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC18:0 "With the growing demand of pearls, farmers and fishermen had to find a way to produce more pearls. After decades of failure, a farmer found a way to graft pearl oysters, and get much quality pearls at a faster pace. This practice has spreaded, especially in the Pacific. However, some people used these techniques to increase drastically their production, at the detriment of quality. The market has been flooded with pearls, and their prices dropped considerably."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT18:0 "Ok."
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME19:0 "Giant Pearl"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC19:0 "During a trip, a fisherman found an oyster with a pearl of an extraordinary size. This is the largest pearl ever found by man. Of course, there is no way to wear ir around the neck, or to make a crown out of it. This giant pearl became a museum piece that arouses much admiration. Many people are discovering pearls this way, and not surprisingly, many women ask their husbands to offer them one -or even several- for their birthday..."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT19:0 "Ah, women..."
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME20:0 "The Amber Road"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC20:0 "The Amber Road is, with the Tin Road, one of the most important trade routes of classical antiquity. This road connects the Baltic Sea, where are almost all the amber reserves, to the Mediterranean Sea. Amber was highly sought by the Egyptians, the Greeks and the Phoenicians; Romans perpetuated this tradition. Cheaper than gold for a similar luster, jewelers were fighting over this wonder of nature."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT20:0 "Ok."
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME21:0 "Fossilized Mosquitoes"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC21:0 "Amber is fossilized resin, which sometimes traps animals or plants; these organisms then travel through time in perfect condition. Actually, a few mosquitoes from the Jurassic Period have been found in Central America. One of them still has blood in his abdomen. Researchers were able to collect the blood, and found some dinosaur DNA. By finding other fossilized mosquitoes, it would even be possible to recreate some species, millions of years after their extinction. As a consequence, amber becomes one of the most sought after gems."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT21:0 "My dream of visiting a dinosaur park is coming true!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME22:0 "Grog"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC22:0 "One of your admirals had the idea of adding a liter of hot water to every quart of rum distributed to his sailors, in order to reduce their consumption of rum. Wearing a coat of grogram cloth, the sailors quickly named him and his drink "grog". In addition to reducing alcoholism, this drink also proves to be an excellent remedy to fight colds and chills, while avoiding being drunk. Rum has become famous, and is now distributed to all sailors in ration form."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT22:0 "Ahoy!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME23:0 "Thanksgiving"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC23:0 "Historically, Thanksgiving is a day of celebration in European peasant societies, where God is thanked for the good things he has achieved during the year. The tradition has crossed the Atlantic to celebrate the harvests in the New World. In order to celebrate particularly abundant harvests, one of the colonies decided to share their meal with the chief of the nearby native tribe, who came with cranberries as a present. This meal has become an opportunity to celebrate and be together, despite our differences. This tradition continues today."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT23:0 "Don't forget the turkey..."
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME24:0 "Clacissism"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC24:0 "Classicism is a cultural and artistic movement that has developed in Europe. As a direct consequence of the Renaissance, it is defined by a set of values and criteria that develops an aesthetic based on a quest for perfection. Art is mainly inspired by the achievements of Antiquity. The marble is once again considered as a noble material, entering into the composition of numerous monuments and constructions."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT24:0 "Fantastic!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME25:0 "Colonization of the New World"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC25:0 "Thousands of settlers are now rushing through the raging oceans, in search of a better life in the New World. The lands to colonize are vast, but the infrastructures are non-existent. These pioneers do their best to settle down, and build entire villages with wood gathered from the surrounding forests. Lumberjacks and carpenters are now among the most requested occupations, and this has a huge impact on the price of wood. The wood industry has never been so successful."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT25:0 "Maybe we should send over some firefighters as well. Just in case."
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME26:0 "Decrease in Demand for Firewood"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC26:0 "The wood industry is not what it used to be. Industrialization has brought coal into households and factories, and the development of electricity means that firewood is less and less in demand. On the other hand, voices are beginning to rise in favor of forest protection. We must therefore expect a steep drop in the price of wood for the coming years."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT26:0 "I understand"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME27:0 "Great Fire"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC27:0 "A huge fire occurred in one of the towns of the country. All the intrastructures have been destroyed by flames, and hundreds of people died. While most cities are immune to such atrocious events, this is not the case for small towns and villages, since most of them only have wooden houses. This devastating fire makes it clear that timber should be abandoned in favor of stronger materials, such as stone or brick."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT27:0 "This is appalling..."
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME28:0 "Noah's Ark"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC28:0 "This started as a rumor, but the news is now confirmed. The remains of what appears to be a huge wooden arch have been found in the mountains of the Near East. Theologians are formal. These remains are the foundations of Noah's Ark, a ship built on God's command to save Noah, his family and a couple from each species from the Flood about to happen. Of course, this news made a lot of people smile; but surprisingly, the demand for timber has never been stronger. Would people fear the arrival of a new Flood? Especially since skeletons of animals have also been found on site. A couple of each species. Strange..."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT28:0 "Did they find a couple of penguins? I need to know!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME29:0 "Engagement Rings"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC29:0 "A rich nobleman, jealous of a suitor who wanted to marry the woman he was in love with, had the idea of asking a jeweler to create a delicate ring with diamonds in the shape of his first initial. He offered this gift to the young woman, who immediately agreed to marry him. Love is a halo of mystery, but it seems that a jewel can charm any young lady in search of a husband - even if the latter has a repulsive look. After all, as long as his wallet is well stocked... Anyway! This jewel, called "engagement ring", has quickly become a popular symbol to mark the promise of eternal love."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT29:0 "I guess congratulations are in order!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME30:0 "The Democratization of Jewelry"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC30:0 "The Industrial Revolution and the emergence of mass production have made accessible products which used to be considered as luxurious. This is the case of jewelery. Formerly reserved for nobles and royalty because of its prohibitive cost, jewels are now a symbol of luxury accessible to the petty bourgeoisie, and even to those able to make serious savings. There are more and more jewelry stores in the big cities and they offer accessories for every budget and need."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT30:0 "Excellent!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME31:0 "Challenger's Flavour Bonanza Mod"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC31:0 "Tired of having to recreate his mod from scratch every time Paradox decides to add a new update to Europa Universalis IV, mod genius Challenger decided to make a complete overhaul of his mod. This news angered the mod community, until they realized how smooth and bugless the game seems to be now (even if there are still bugs, hey, no one is perfect). As a consequence, users are eager to play more and more, which results in the acquisition of better computers."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT31:0 "I support this new mod! <3"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME32:0 "Europeans Dicovered Potatoes"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC32:0 "Potatoes have been grown in South America for millennia. The Incas even venerated Axomama, goddess of the potato. When the first Europeans arrived in the Peruvian region, they were very surprised by these tubers, which the explorers brought back to Europe aboard their galleons. Adapting very well to European soils, the potato quickly sets out to conquer the Old Continent."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT32:0 "Excellent!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME33:0 "Fries"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC33:0 "The origin of the fries remains controversial. Its name comes from 'fried potatoes', later reduced to the simple term 'fries'. Over time, fries have become the main way to cook potatoes, becoming one of the favorite foods of people of all ages and all walks of life."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT33:0 "Yummy!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME34:0 "Irish Potato Famine"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC34:0 "The potato crisis is the name given to a major famine that has been triggered by decades of political instability, inappropriate farming methods and the appearance of late blight, a parasite that almost completely wiped out local potato crops, which was staple food for many peasants. This famine decimated the whole nation, but also impacted the entire continent. In the absence of a treatment, late blight spread across the land, making potatoes unfit for consumption."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT34:0 "This is terrible..."
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME35:0 "Vulcanization"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC35:0 "Vulcanization is a chemical process whose name comes from the Roman god Vulcan. The process involves incorporating a vulcanizing agent (essentially sulfur) into a crude elastomer to form, after firing, bridges between the molecular chains. This operation makes the material more elastic instead of plastic. This is the first major discovery that has allowed the use of rubber in the industry."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT35:0 "Fantastic!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME36:0 "Rubber Boots"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC36:0 "Thanks to the Industrial Revolution, the means of production are changing. It is also a time when many scientific discoveries are made. After discovering that rubber dissolved in a solvent has a high waterproofing value, rubber starts to be used in the industry, but into in the composition of goods. The invention of rubber boots is a real innovation, bringing benefits to both the military and civilians."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT36:0 "Excellent!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME37:0 "Rubber Tires"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC37:0 "After a first failure, the rubber tire was destined to disappear. However, its use has proved very effective for bicycles. A new tire system with inner tube has then been put in place. Even more efficient, they greatly increased the performance of the first racing cyclists in history. Very quickly, the car industy took possession of the invention. The first rubber-tired cars have been designed, and the tire became one of the essential elements for any mass-produced vehicle. Rubber has become a key element for the economic growth of the automotive sector."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT37:0 "Here we go, boys and girls!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME38:0 "Public Lighting"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC38:0 "The first modern uses of natural gas appear with public lighting. The establishment of the first lanterns had been done in Paris around 1667. During the following century, oil replaced candles with double wicks. However, lighting gas, discovered a few decades ago, is more effective than oil. The lanterns of the main cities of the world are slowly adopting this new process. Gas lighting will continue until the democratization of electricity, a few decades later."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT38:0 "Let there be light!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME39:0 "Pipelines"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC39:0 "Natural gas is extracted in places that can be very far from urban centers. Pipes are then built to transport the gas in the cities. Inspired by the techniques of the Romans, who had built many pipes in wood or terracotta for the transport of water, the first modern pipelines are made possible thanks to advances in metallurgy, which now allows the transport of materials under pressure. These pipes will inspire a few years later larger pipelines, meant to transport oil to refineries."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT39:0 "Excellent!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME40:0 "Liquefied Natural Gas"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC40:0 "Liquefied natural gas (abbreviated as LNG) is a commercial grade natural gas condensed in a liquid state. It is mainly used as a means of transporting natural gas from producing countries to consuming countries by sea. It is also used as fuel for ships and land vehicles. Because of its slightly lower toxicity, its combustion is less polluting than that of other fossil energies. As a consequence, natural gas is becoming a cheaper alternative to coal, whose reserves are dwindling day by day."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT40:0 "Interesting."
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME41:0 "The Encyclopedia"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC41:0 "The Encyclopedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts, is the symbol of the Age of Enlightenment. It is one of the first encyclopedias, gathering for the first tima mass amounts of knowledge, calling into question many ideas received from the Middle Ages. Volumes have been written over a long period, under the direction of the greatest scholars of society. The Encyclopedia was printed at 4,255 copies, which is a very big quantity at a time when the usual circulation of books was three times smaller. The Encyclopedia has been widely distributed abroad, supporting the ideas of the Enlightenment to North America, precipitating the American Revolution."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT41:0 "Looks like I'll have a lot to read..."
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME42:0 "Paperback Books"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC42:0 "A paperback book is supposed to be small enough to fit in a pocket has has a relatively low price, in return for a lower quality. Most often, these are reprints of books that have already had significant success in their original format. This is a real revolution in the world of printing and bookstores. The paperback book helps to democratize reading, making the book accessible to all segments of the population. At least to those who know how to read..."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT42:0 "Wonderful!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME43:0 "Harry Potter"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC43:0 "While she was on a crowded train, a novelist had the idea of a character going to a school of witchcraft. A few years later, the first adventures of the young Harry Potter are published. The success is immediate among young readers, but the book exceeds all expectations, and also interests adults. Although media arts have seriously damaged the book industry, the pleasure of reading has been rediscovered by the population. The last volume of the adventures of the Boy Who Lived became the best-selling book in history... and gave many ideas to writers who now all want to become the next J.K. Rowling."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT43:0 "Expelliarmus!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME44:0 "Aluminum Smelting"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC44:0 "Attempts to produce aluminium metal date back to the 18th century. Since its production was extremely expensive, the demand for aluminium remained low. An engineer found a way to smelt aluminum, by extracting aluminium from its oxide, alumina. A large amount of carbon is also used in this process, resulting in significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. With that process, aluminum wire and foil can be produced. Modern production has started, and aluminium has become a symbol of the future."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT44:0 "Excellent!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME45:0 "Aluminum Can"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC45:0 "Aluminum became very important in military and research. It also has become a part of everyday lives, being an essential component of houseware. Someone had the idea of developing a container for packaging made primarily of aluminum. It is now commonly used for foods and beverages such as milk and soup, but also for products such as oil, chemicals, and other liquids. Global production of the aluminum can already exceed one billion units a year, and constitutes the biggest single use of aluminum globally."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT45:0 "Soda for everyone!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME46:0 "Industrialization of toilet paper"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC46:0 "Industrialization makes it possible to produce more, while bringing additional comfort to the population. Our nation, for its end, is the first to manufacture industrially paper for hygienic needs."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT46:0 "This will change our lives!"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME47:0 "Panic in supermarkets"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC47:0 "News of the blatant instability of our nation has been spread around the world. Many people see this as the possible outbreak of a world war, and drive to supermarkets to acquire essential goods. The majority of retail stores are now out of toilet paper."
cpbm_prices.EVTOPT47:0 "I would understand for oil, but... toilet paper!?"
cpbm_prices.EVTNAME48:0 "Global panic"
cpbm_prices.EVTDESC48:0 "The city of Wuhan is the epicenter of one of the greatest pandemics of the modern era. People all over the world panic and rush into supermarkets. In less than twenty-four hours, all supplies of toilet paper were gone, without anyone understanding why."
