waldensian_religion_desc:0 "Waldensianism is a Christian denomination that originated in Lyon and Lombardy in the 12th century. They are also known as "The Poor of Lyon" or "The Poor of Lombardy". The people of the Waldensian faith live in voluntary poverty and lack of possessions. While the Lyonese believers were living off of donations and self-sufficient work only, the Lombardian followers of the faith also allowed paid work in work communes in order to earn money to afford live. The Waldensian faith rejects the idea of purgatory, indulgence and worship of saints and relics, as well as wealth of the Church in general. They also didn't support child babtism, because they wanted the baptised to actively accept it. While the Waldensians did accept the Church hiearchy to some degree, they were highly in favor of having lay priests and everyone doing personal bible studies."

The followers reject the idea of indulgence, purgatory, the worshipping of saints and relics. They also denounce the wealth of the Church and volunteer for a life in poverty. The established Christian churches have denounced Waldensianism as heretical."

et_waldensian_events.EVTNAME2:0 "Spread of Waldensianism"
et_waldensian_events.EVTDESC2:0 "Waldensianism is slowly spreading in [Root.GetName] through its followers. Waldensianism does not only denounce wealth, especially within the Church, but also regularly organizes food for the poor. Furthermore it makes use of lay priests. Those particularities help them spreading among the peasantry."
