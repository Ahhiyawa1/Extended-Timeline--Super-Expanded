A crucial element in the maintenance and spreading of this military know-how, along with traditional histories, were the various treatises and practical manuals. These continued a tradition that stretched back to Xenophon and Aeneas the Tactician, and many Byzantine military manuals excerpt or adapt the works of ancient authors, especially Aelian and Onasander. Characteristically Byzantine manuals were first produced in the sixth century. They greatly proliferate in the tenth century, when the Byzantines embarked on their conquests in the East and the Balkans, but production abated after the early eleventh century. There is some evidence of similar works being written in the Palaiologan era."

As our Roman Empire stands upon the brink of being overwhelmed by the infidel Turk, the Pope of Rome has finally agreed to the long-standing Orthodox request for a Great Ecumenical Council to address the question of the Schism between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. However, while the pope has finally conceded an open discussion and debate on questions of reunion, it is not clear that the Roman See's terms will have changed substantially since the last attempt at Church Union in 1274. Yet, in practical terms, we would be grateful of western aid against the Mahometans, while the Roman pope would no doubt be pleased to be able to use the 'return' of the Orthodox to the Catholic fold as a way of facing down demands for reform from his own churchmen who oppose his monopoly of power. Shall we agree to attend the council?"

The villagers clearly saw that he planned to steal the saint's relics, just as the Venetians stole the relics of St Nicholas from Myra in Lycia.
