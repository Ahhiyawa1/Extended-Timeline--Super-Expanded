byz_faction.d.1:0 "A General who claims to hail from a northern border province has offered his services to the Imperial Court. The man is clearly of some talent, and can most likely be a boon to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ administration. However, accepting the aid of this man of statecraft will strengthen the Military Senators at court."
byz_faction.a.1:0 "Of course we are interested!"
byz_faction.b.1:0 "We need no more generals around here"
byz_faction.t.2:0 "General Schemes for Influence"
byz_faction.d.2:0 "A powerful General within our court has been engaging in intense political maneuvering the last few months. The man is one of our foremost advisers in matters of statecraft, and his scheming threatens to increase the Military deme's influence in court."
byz_faction.a.2:0 "Behead him before things get worse"
byz_faction.b.2:0 "Allow him to continue his plotting"
byz_faction.t.3:0 "General Isolate The Emperor"
byz_faction.d.3:0 "The Military demes has advanced its positions within the Imperial court. By employing a tactic of constantly tailing the Emperor and building trust with him at every opportunity, the Military Senators have managed to outmaneuver several previously influential courtiers from the other demes."
byz_faction.a.3:0 "They give good advice"
byz_faction.b.3:0 "The Emperor takes advice from no one!"
byz_faction.t.4:0 "A Grave for an Admiral"
byz_faction.d.4:0 "A powerful Admiral within the Imperial Court has died due to old age. The death of this powerful eminence has left a power vacuum that the other demes are now seeking to fill. While the Military demes will be weakened from this loss, we could soften the blow by providing the man with a stately funeral, as a token of our appreciation."
byz_faction.a.4:0 "The state has no money to spend"
byz_faction.b.4:0 "Naturally we wish to aid those in need"
byz_faction.t.5:0 "The Bosporus Trade"
byz_faction.d.5:0 "The Bosporus trade in salts and silver has been flourishing over the past few years, but officials from the provinces are complaining that more and more wealth from the countryside is being washed away to the coastal cities with every flood. Military Senators have proposed a scheme aimed at reducing the importance of the trade."
byz_faction.a.5:0 "This will surely please the officials!"
byz_faction.b.5:0 "The trade is an important source of wealth"
byz_faction.t.6:0 "A General's Vase"
byz_faction.d.6:0 "One of our most respected courtiers belonging to the Military deme has presented us with an expensive gift in the form of an enormous yet delicate porcelain vase. The vase is decorated with intricate dragon symbolism, and you hesitate to think what fortunes it must have cost to acquire it."
byz_faction.a.6:0 "We must accept this offering!"
byz_faction.b.6:0 "It really is too much!"
byz_faction.t.7:0 "Destitute Banknotes"
byz_faction.d.7:0 "Inflation is becoming more and more of a problem in $COUNTRY$, as more and more unbacked notes are issued by the Central Government. One of our courtiers from the Military deme has proposed a scheme to reinvigorate the country's economy by means of a temporary tax combined with reforms to the Treasury. While you have some doubts about the validity of his ideas, the money that the scheme promises to bring in could be put to good use."
byz_faction.a.7:0 "This all sounds very interesting!"
byz_faction.b.7:0 "Only hard work can reform the currency"
byz_faction.t.8:0 "Quick-fingered Senator"
byz_faction.d.8:0 "Money has been mysteriously disappearing from the Imperial treasury for some time now, and you have started to direct your suspicions to a court soldier employed as a treasury book keeper."
byz_faction.a.8:0 "Execute him!"
byz_faction.b.8:0 "Best to keep quiet about this"
byz_faction.t.9:0 "Military deme Excels at Examinations"
byz_faction.d.9:0 "A young courtier associated with the Military deme in palace politics has excelled at this year's Imperial Examinations. The rise of young talent within the Military deme is bound to strengthen the deme, unless we take steps and measures to prevent that."
byz_faction.a.9:0 "This man must be granted a place in court!"
byz_faction.b.9:0 "I'm sure he can find work in the provinces"
byz_faction.t.10:0 "The General's Vice"
byz_faction.d.10:0 "One of the influential senators of the Military deme harbors a dark secret. For some time, the young courtier in question has been under the influence of an ever worsening and consuming opium addiction. General has requested that the matter be kept under a lid, and promises that he will try to reform his ways, and to try to practice moderation in the future."
byz_faction.a.10:0 "I suppose we can overlook this"
byz_faction.b.10:0 "It would be cheaper to fire him"
byz_faction.t.11:0 "The Examinations of $YEAR$"
byz_faction.d.11:0 "Pupils and Examinees associated with the Administration deme have outperformed themselves and most everyone else at this year's Imperial Examination. The successes at the examinations promises good things for the Administrative deme senators, who can now extend their influence in palace politics. What shall we do with all these newly examined officials?"
byz_faction.a.11:0 "Put them to work in the provinces"
byz_faction.b.11:0 "Use them to reform the administration"
byz_faction.t.12:0 "A Roman Seal"
byz_faction.d.12:0 "Your majesty has been presented with a formidable gift in the form of a Ancient Roman seal of some level of craftsmanship. The gift has been presented by an up and coming senators associated with the Admin demes. As nothing is free in The Roman Kingdom, he probably expects us to return the favor."
byz_faction.a.12:0 "He expects too much"
byz_faction.b.12:0 "Naturally we accept the gift!"
byz_faction.t.13:0 "The $PROVINCENAME$ Levy"
byz_faction.d.13:0 "Senators from the Admin deme have undertaken a project to expand the levy in $PROVINCENAME$ by improving and updating the local censuses. The reform promises to bring additional manpower to the Imperial Army, and improve the province's future troop recruitment. Not carrying out these reforms means weakening the Administrative deme, and will also leave the locals in $PROVINCENAME$ free to produce other things of value."
byz_faction.a.13:0 "Naturally these reforms are called for"
byz_faction.b.13:0 "No need to harass the peasantry"
byz_faction.t.14:0 "Field Marshal Dishonored"
byz_faction.d.14:0 "One of our Field Marshals has been caught red-handed siphoning off funds intended for the northern defenses. The Field Marshal is associated with the Palatial Administrative deme, and the disgrace he has brought to himself is bound to reflect negatively on the deme."
byz_faction.a.14:0 "Execute him!"
byz_faction.b.14:0 "Forgive him"
byz_faction.t.15:0 "Heir Lends an Ear"
byz_faction.d.15:0 "We have noticed that our heir apparent has grown closer to certain courtiers and officials who are known affiliates of the Administrative deme. It appears that your heir sympathizes with the Administrative deme and its political position. We could attempt to stop these friendships from growing, but having powerful friends in court can be a good thing for our young heir when he assumes the throne."
byz_faction.a.15:0 "Leave your heir be"
byz_faction.b.15:0 "Stop the Senators!"
byz_faction.t.16:0 "Religious Wisdom"
byz_faction.d.16:0 "One of the Imperial Senators affiliated with the Administrative deme has developed a reputation as quite the scholar. The man is specialized in the writings of St. Peter, and it is said that he is capable of reciting broad parts of the St. Peter's corpus by heart. A scholar of such erudition brings influence and power to his deme."
byz_faction.a.16:0 "Converse with the scholar"
byz_faction.b.16:0 "Put the man to work"
byz_faction.t.17:0 "Literati Publishes"
byz_faction.d.17:0 "A scholar affiliated with the Administrative deme has published a novel that has been hailed by commentators as one of the greatest achievements of contemporary literature. The publication of such an important work increases the standing of both the writer and his deme."
byz_faction.a.17:0 "He is a credit to his nation"
byz_faction.b.17:0 "I didn't think it was that good"
byz_faction.t.18:0 "Retainer Flogged"
byz_faction.d.18:0 "One of the big names within the Administrative deme has earned himself a reputation for cruelty since taking to regularly flogging a particular retainer of his, of whom he seems to have a particular distaste. While the Administrative Senator is fully within his rights to punish his lessers, people generally feel that his treatment could benefit from a little moderation."
byz_faction.a.18:0 "He's setting an excellent example!"
byz_faction.b.18:0 "Tell him to control himself"
byz_faction.t.19:0 "Drama on The Mesta River"
byz_faction.d.19:0 "A Mesta River tax barge, containing a significant share of this year's taxes from the eastern provinces, has been boarded and seized by pirates. The official responsible for maintaining security on the relevant section of the river, a young senator from the Administrative deme, has suffered a nervous breakdown after hearing about the incident and is reportedly locked up in his bedchamber, refusing to come out."
byz_faction.a.19:0 "I guess we can kiss those taxes goodbye"
byz_faction.b.19:0 "Levy extra taxes to remedy the situation"
byz_faction.t.20:0 "Gold Mine Discovered"
byz_faction.d.20:0 "A gold mine has been discovered in one of our provinces, and the man in charge of the prospecting that went into finding it is reportedly a young senator affiliated with the Administrative deme. Exploiting this new and rich lode may seem like a foregone conclusion, but some warn against the venture, citing concerns over a potential overextension of the money supply."
byz_faction.a.20:0 "Dig deep and greedily!"
byz_faction.b.20:0 "Let sleeping dogs lie"
byz_faction.t.21:0 "Bullion Leaves the Country"
byz_faction.d.21:0 "Large amounts of silver bullion have left the country on various trade barges sailing from our many ports. Officials in the Administrative deme are being blamed for the development, as their statist trade policy is believed to be causing the exodus of wealth."
byz_faction.a.21:0 "Expensive!"
byz_faction.b.21:0 "Mint more to make up for the losses"
byz_faction.t.22:0 "Renovating old Imperial Gardens"
byz_faction.d.22:0 "An old Komnenos Dynasty gardens in one of our provinces has fallen into disrepair after several years of neglected maintenance, and now a local official has requested funds to restore them. The official in question is related to the Administrative deme, so any money spent on the gardens will also be money spent on the Administrative senators."
byz_faction.a.22:0 "Naturally we shall restore it"
byz_faction.b.22:0 "We have no time for such nonsense"
byz_faction.t.23:0 "The Birinus's Smile"
byz_faction.d.23:0 "The writings of Saint Birinus are being forgotten in $PROVINCENAME$, as the inhabitants there have more and more taken to practicing Herecy rite. The news comes as a major setback for the Diplomatic deme, which has prided itself on the successes of state-sanctioned Orthodoxy. We could dispatch officials to immediately restore order to the province, but forcing the locals into a different faith will most likely hurt the economic viability of the province."
byz_faction.a.23:0 "They may believe what they wish"
byz_faction.b.23:0 "Dispatch officials immediately"
byz_faction.t.24:0 "Crack-down on Heresy"
byz_faction.d.24:0 "The Diplomatic deme has taken matters into its own hands in $PROVINCENAME$ recently, where religious heresies have previously been known to ferment. The Diplomatic deme has been quite active in the area, spreading the word of God. If we allow the Diplomatic deme to continue working in the province, it is likely that the local religious affiliation will change."
byz_faction.a.24:0 "Excellent!"
byz_faction.b.24:0 "Leave those poor locals be"
byz_faction.t.25:0 "Diplomacy of the Senate"
byz_faction.d.25:0 "Officials from the Diplomatic deme of Senate have been very active in the foreign diplomacy of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Court lately. One foreign power in particular occupies the deme's attention, and the deme feels that this foreign power should submit to the authority of The Roman Kingdom. The foreign ambassador has been summoned to the imperial palace, what shall we tell him?"
byz_faction.a.25:0 "That he may go in peace"
byz_faction.b.25:0 "That he best prepare his defenses"
byz_faction.t.26:0 "Bound Feet"
byz_faction.d.26:0 "Keeping the feet of young girls bound and tied until every bone in them has grown broken and deformed creates wonders of female and human beauty. The fashion of bound feet waxes and wanes every hundred years or so, and this time the wax seems to be due to the fact that the Diplomatic deme is actively promoting this sound ideal of beauty all over the country."
byz_faction.a.26:0 "Everyone must follow this example!"
byz_faction.b.26:0 "This sounds a bit over the top"
byz_faction.t.27:0 "Imperial Insults"
byz_faction.d.27:0 "A young senator of the Diplomatic deme, employed in the reception of foreign dignitaries and potentates to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ court, has caused a diplomatic blunder today, when he, contrary to protocol, bowed two times rather than three when greeting a foreign diplomat. This major loss of face for the courtier has quickly developed into a loss of face for the entire Diplomatic deme!"
byz_faction.a.27:0 "Apologize to the foreigner"
byz_faction.b.27:0 "Behead the courtier"
byz_faction.t.28:0 "Inspecting The Banners"
byz_faction.d.28:0 "The armies have amassed on the exercise field for the Grand Army Inspection of $YEAR$. Everywhere you look there is a forest of spears and swords, aiming in defiance at the heavens above. Several powerful generals and marshals are present, many of who are from the Diplomatic deme, which, for the past few years, has done everything in its power to strengthen its position within the army."
byz_faction.a.28:0 "Commend the generals for their work"
byz_faction.b.28:0 "You call this an army!?"
byz_faction.t.29:0 "Diplomatic deme Conspiracy"
byz_faction.d.29:0 "A conspiracy has formed within the ranks of the socially conservative Diplomatic deme, which has begun maneuvering to make the Diplomatic deme dominant within palace politics. By promoting their own candidates at Imperial Examinations those senators has begun an ascension to power which is quite remarkable. How should we deal with the Diplomatic's deme conspiracies?"
byz_faction.a.29:0 "Nothing. It is merely politics"
byz_faction.b.29:0 "Behead a few big-wigs"
byz_faction.t.30:0 "Examining the Examinations"
byz_faction.d.30:0 "An official from the Military deme has published a document detailing his criticisms of alleged biases and flaws in the present processes of Imperial Examinations. The official has included a short list of suggestions of simple changes that, in his opinion, would vastly improve the quality of the process. The suggestions fly in the collective face of the Diplomatic deme, which has vigorously defended the Examinations against any and all new-fangled ideas."
byz_faction.a.30:0 "Change we can believe in!"
byz_faction.b.30:0 "The Diplomatic deme has the right idea!"
byz_faction.t.31:0 "A Gift From the Diplomatic deme senator"
byz_faction.d.31:0 "A high magistrate affiliated with the Diplomatic deme has presented your Majesty with a most exquisite gift: A copy of the Orthodox classic 'The Book of Rites' dated to the late Konstantinos dynasty. The gift echoes the political debate within the Palace, where the Diplomatic deme usually argues in favor of Eastern Orthodoxy."
byz_faction.a.31:0 "Study the book closely"
byz_faction.b.31:0 "Silly books. Change!"
byz_faction.t.32:0 "Records of the Grand Historian"
byz_faction.d.32:0 "$MONARCHTITLE$, You have reigned for some time now, and many consider it time to compile another grand edition of the 'Records of the Grand Historian'. The Grand Historian himself is affiliated with the Diplomatic deme. Compiling a tome detailing the fortunes of Basileia Rhomanion during your reign would cost a fair bit of money, and give prestige to the Diplomatic deme, but the benefits might outweigh the costs. Shall we put the historian to work?"
byz_faction.a.32:0 "Yes!"
byz_faction.b.32:0 "No!"
byz_faction.t.33:0 "An Athos Monk"
byz_faction.d.33:0 "A traveler from Mount Athos has arrived in $CAPITAL$. He says that he has traveled from far-away Mount Athos, and that he comes to spread the word of the God. The Diplomatic deme opposes this request, preferring instead the traditional teachings of Orthodoxy as the sole font of spiritual guidance for our people. While there is a case to be made for the Diplomatic deme's position, overly heavy-handed treatment of other Religies will destabilize our country."
byz_faction.a.33:0 "Of course he is free to preach"
byz_faction.b.33:0 "We should weed out this pest!"
byz_faction.t.34:0 "Burning of Books"
byz_faction.d.34:0 "The Diplomatic deme has had enough of the discord and strife that plagues $COUNTRY$. Pointing to the myriad of schools of thought that flourish within the realm it is no wonder, they argue, that we live in troubled times. The Diplomatic deme holds that only a return to true Orthodox values can restore order, and what better way than to burn a few books of heterodox teachings?"
byz_faction.a.34:0 "That does sound like an idea!"
byz_faction.b.34:0 "Some other time, perhaps"
byz_faction.t.35:0 "Burying of Scholars"
byz_faction.d.35:0 "The Diplomatic deme, tired of the pluralistic thought climate that has taken hold in Basileia Rhomaion in the past few years, has taken matter into its own hands. In several provinces all over the country several prominent scholars of other schools than the official Orthodox doctrine have been buried alive. That this will be a blow to innovation is already clear, but how shall we punish the Diplomatic deme senators?"
byz_faction.a.35:0 "Forgive and forget!"
byz_faction.b.35:0 "Repay them in kind"
byz_faction.t.36:0 "Konstantinos Statuette"
byz_faction.d.36:0 "A rare statuette from the Konstantinos the Great era has been discovered during renovations of an old Temple. The idea has crossed your mind that it might be clever to bestow the statuette upon a worthy subject to strengthen his loyalty to you, The Emperor. Deme loyalties will doubtlessly change on account of such an impressive gift delivered directly from the Emperor's own hand. Who shall we give it to?"
byz_faction.a.36:0 "The Grand Historian"
byz_faction.b.36:0 "The Eldest Official"
byz_faction.c.36:0 "The Grand Marshal"
byz_faction.t.37:0 "The Classic of Music"
byz_faction.d.37:0 "Apart from the five classic texts compiled by Christian Saints, tradition also speaks of a sixth Classic: The Classic of Music. One of the 305 songs originally contained in this work, which has been lost since 'The Burning of Books' has been rediscovered during an inventory of an old library in one of the Southern provinces. The claim to this marvelous discovery undoubtedly belongs partly to the Head Librarian, associated with the Military deme, but two other candidates also claim to have had part in the discovery. Who do we credit?"
byz_faction.a.37:0 "The Province Governor"
byz_faction.b.37:0 "A Local Literati"
byz_faction.t.38:0 "Cheating at Examinations"
byz_faction.d.38:0 "Several examinees have been caught cheating at the Imperial Examinations this year. Instead of the prescribed three day solitude, the examinees have had ready access to the outside world. The cheating was discovered when several disallowed manuscripts were found in the examinees' rooms. The cheating appears systematic and supported by corrupt examinators. Three primary suspects have been identified. Who do we blame?"
byz_faction.a.38:0 "The Head Examinator"
byz_faction.b.38:0 "A Court Eunuch"
byz_faction.c.38:0 "A Scholar at the Examination Center"
byz_faction.t.39:0 "Withdrawing Excess Paper"
byz_faction.d.39:0 "There is general consensus within the Imperial Court that the amount of fiduciary media in circulation is a number much too great for the good of the state finances. That money must be recalled in order for inflation to recede from its current level goes without saying, but the question is how much money should be rebought. The demes have their varying solutions, and your Majesty is free to choose one of them."
byz_faction.a.39:0 "The Administrative Solution"
byz_faction.b.39:0 "The Military Solution"
byz_faction.c.39:0 "The Diplomatic Solution"
byz_faction.t.40:0 "Honoring the Ancestors"
byz_faction.d.40:0 "The teachings of Christian Saint stress the importance of understanding and respecting old books that weave the web of society, and one of the most important relationships is that between father and son. Those who have gone before us deserve our thanksgiving, and it has been long enough since last we made an offering. Various courtiers have suggested sacrifices that your Majesty could perform. What seems most appropriate to present as an offering to honor the ancestors?"
byz_faction.a.40:0 "Red meat, to keep them fed"
byz_faction.b.40:0 "Candles, to light their way"
byz_faction.c.40:0 "Spirit money, to pay their dues"
byz_faction.t.41:0 "Bad results"
byz_faction.d.41:0 "We have started to build a new Temple, but something gone wrong. Who is responsible for this?"
byz_faction.a.41:0 "The diviner himself, he's clearly gone mad"
byz_faction.b.41:0 "The builder, he did not consult the diviners"
byz_faction.c.41:0 "Whoever put me up to building it"
byz_faction.t.42:0 "Court Bickering"
byz_faction.d.42:0 "One of your Marshals has been insulted by a high ranking senator from the Administrative deme. Apparently the men have had a hard time getting along for quite some time, and the insult was probably not entirely unprovoked. Nevertheless the matter has become a pivot point of demeal politics at the court, and it might be wise if The Emperor himself gave some input on the issue."
byz_faction.a.42:0 "The Marshal needs to stop complaining"
byz_faction.b.42:0 "The Senator needs to apologize"
byz_faction.c.42:0 "The Emperor needs a vacation"
byz_faction.t.43:0 "The Necropolis of $MONARCH$"
byz_faction.d.43:0 "$MONARCHTITLE$, there comes a time in the life of every Roman Emperor when he must begin to consider his final resting place. In order to ensure a suitable position for yourself in the hereafter, it is of the utmost importance that you pick a worthy and fitting tomb in this life. The various courtiers have their own ideas on what the centerpiece of a new tomb complex should be."
byz_faction.a.43:0 "Administrative demes: A scale model of Basileia Rhomaion!"
byz_faction.b.43:0 "Diplomatic demes: An army of stone soldiers!"
byz_faction.c.43:0 "Military demes: Near his ancestors!"
byz_faction.t.44:0 "The Gilded Garden"
byz_faction.d.44:0 "Wrapped in the reddish gold of a dying sun, and reflecting the blue of the heavens suspended above it, the old Gilded Garden has stood since the times of the Komnenos dynasty, or perhaps even longer still. The silence and darkness within the Garden is a stark contrast to the light and reflection outside of. Since Oriental Orthodoxy has become rare, the Garden has gone unused, and your courtiers have various suggestions as to what could be done with it."
byz_faction.a.44:0 "Military demes: Melt it down and mint the gold!"
byz_faction.b.44:0 "Administrative demes: Turn it into an examination center!"
byz_faction.c.44:0 "Diplomatic demes: Leave its beauty undisturbed"
byz_faction.t.45:0 "The Shadow that Stalks the Corridor"
byz_faction.d.45:0 "As you walk through the long corridors of the Sacred Palace, you suddenly have a distinct sense of being followed. In the corner of your eye a white-clad man approaches you from behind. You cannot see the dagger, gleaming with malice, but you know it is there, behind you, a mere few yards from your heart. Before you the corridor splits. To your right is the Senate Military deme quarter, guards and safety, and to your left lies the Administrative deme quarters. What do you do?"
byz_faction.a.45:0 "Flee to the Military deme Senator!"
byz_faction.b.45:0 "Flee to the Administrative deme Senator!"
byz_faction.c.45:0 "Stand and fight!"
byz_faction.t.46:0 "Administrative Senator Swindles the Treasury"
byz_faction.d.46:0 "A high ranking member of the Administrative deme has been caught siphoning funds out of the Imperial Treasury and into his own pocket. The only punishment that can at all be considered is of course death, but the question of who should replace him is less obvious. There are powerful candidates within both the Military and Diplomatic demes, but the candidates from the Administrative deme are doubtlessly the ones best equipped to handle the job. Who should get the job?"
byz_faction.a.46:0 "A Military Senator Candidate"
byz_faction.b.46:0 "A Diplomatic Senator Candidate"
byz_faction.c.46:0 "Sigh. Find a new Administrative Senator"
byz_faction.t.47:0 "Brigands on the old trade road"
byz_faction.d.47:0 "Things have quickly gone from bad to worse in several provinces across the country, where brigands and highwaymen are becoming ever more of a problem. The problem has been particularly noticeable along what remains of the old 'From Varagians to Greeks'. The matter was discussed recently at a Senate session of the Imperial Court, and several solutions to the brigand problem were presented. How shall we combat the brigands?"
byz_faction.a.47:0 "With a large scale military campaign"
byz_faction.b.47:0 "By setting up local militias"
byz_faction.c.47:0 "Through prayers and faith"
byz_faction.t.48:0 "Reputation for Cruelty"
byz_faction.d.48:0 "Since reecent events people have begun avoiding you. It did not happen overnight, but progressively, as the months have passed, you have noticed that fewer and fewer people seem to take the time to pay their Emperor the proper respects and courtesies. After some cautious inquiries among trusted retainers you discover the reason: People have begun to fear you. For whatever reason, you have developed a reputation for cruelty. What to do about it?"
byz_faction.a.48:0 "Embrace the reputation"
byz_faction.b.48:0 "Initiate a propaganda campaign"
byz_faction.t.49:0 "Portentous Solar Eclipse"
byz_faction.d.49:0 "You can only stare in awe as the glowing white of the sun disappears behind the black disc suspended in the sky, and the world turns to darkness despite it being mid day. A few minutes later the disc has passed by the sun, and light returns. You are shaken by the experience, but many of your subjects are absolutely terrified. Some whisper that the eclipse proves that throne has passed from our dynasty. What should we make of this situation?"
byz_faction.a.49:0 "Execute the court astrologer"
byz_faction.b.49:0 "Bribe the people"
byz_faction.c.49:0 "Prohibit all discussion of the topic"
byz_faction.t.50:0 "Awakening of The Great Prophet"
byz_faction.d.50:0 "Mysterious rumors are coming from one of our provinces, telling of an old statue of the Prophet that supposedly has come alive and then simply walked off! Whatever the truth, many have begun believing that such omens are signs that our Empire is in danger. The event has caused the teachings of the Oriental Orthodoxy to gain traction in the area. How shall we respond to these rumors?"
byz_faction.a.50:0 "Not at all"
byz_faction.b.50:0 "With violence, how else?"
byz_faction.t.51:0 "Temple Desecrated"
byz_faction.d.51:0 "As the officials enter the Temple in the morning they come upon a chaotic scene. Altars have been overturned, figurines smashed and walls and tapestries defaced. Someone has entered the Temple during the dark hours of the night, and committed the most heinous acts of sacrilege. No one knows who is responsible for these crimes. What shall we do about the Temple?"
byz_faction.a.51:0 "Restore it"
byz_faction.b.51:0 "Tear it down"
byz_faction.t.52:0 "Plague Strikes The Court"
byz_faction.d.52:0 "Plagues, famines, droughts and calamities are becoming increasingly frequent in $COUNTRY$ these days, and now a particularly nasty disease has arrived at court. Yesterday morning an Administrative Senator employed at the Public Works Office was found dead after having complained of a sore throat the day before. The disease is now spreading throughout the court, and several more are already showing symptoms."
byz_faction.a.52:0 "Flee to a countryside province"
byz_faction.b.52:0 "We shall remain in the capital"
byz_faction.t.53:0 "Daggers in the Dark"
byz_faction.d.53:0 "A scream echoes through the palace, but soon dissolves again into the silence and black of the night. A courtier has been murdered, found in his bedchamber with a blade buried deep in his back, and several stab wounds to the rest of his body. Fratricide and internal strife are becoming ever more common in $COUNTRY$, and many believe that you are no longer true Emperor. There are three suspects in the murder case, who did it?"
byz_faction.a.53:0 "The Palace Chef, in the Bedchamber, with a knife"
byz_faction.b.53:0 "The Grand Secretary, in the Bedchamber, with a knife"
byz_faction.c.53:0 "The Grand Marshal, in the Bedchamber, with a knife"
byz_faction.t.54:0 "The Concubine's Child"
byz_faction.d.54:0 "For the past nine months you have been an expecting father, and today one of your concubines did indeed give birth to a son. The joy is cut short, however, when the child is brought before you. His face is deformed into what looks like a permanent scream, and soft, black furlike hair grows in patches over his little body. The child is deformed, and your physician suspects that the deformity has affected his mental capacities as well. Various courtiers are willing to give you advice."
byz_faction.a.54:0 "Diplomatic Senator: Let the child live"
byz_faction.b.54:0 "General: Arrange an accident"
byz_faction.c.54:0 "Administrative Senator: Deny that the child is yours"
byz_faction.t.55:0 "A Riding Accident"
byz_faction.d.55:0 "They present your heir on a stretcher, lying dead before you. He had been out riding with some of his companions, and apparently fell off the horse. You can feel only a quiet rage welling up within you when you think of the futility of his death. The son of the Emperor, dead, not in war or battle, but from a pointless accident. The event is a clear sign that our dynasty are in danger. His companions are from various demes, who should be punished for the incident?"
byz_faction.a.55:0 "The tall one"
byz_faction.b.55:0 "The fair-skinned one"
byz_faction.c.55:0 "The soldier"
byz_faction.t.56:0 "Flawed Insights"
byz_faction.d.56:0 "The Grand Secretaries have recently delivered their reports on the past years' advancements within their respective areas of expertise, and there is dire news. One of the Offices has significantly lowered their estimates of the rate of future progress, and the deme responsible for that department is bound to lose a great deal of face over the event. Which Office was mismanaged?"
byz_faction.a.56:0 "Office of Imperial Administration"
byz_faction.b.56:0 "Office of Taxation & Trade"
byz_faction.c.56:0 "Office of War"
byz_faction.t.57:0 "Gold turns to Lead"
byz_faction.d.57:0 "A shocking discovery has been made in the Imperial treasury today, as several bars of gold have turned out to be nothing save cheap lead. The Grand Secretary responsible for the treasury, an Admiral, claims that the Gold must have been transmuted into lead, and hints that it might be a sign from the heavens that our reign no longer enjoys the blessing of God. The less fantastical explanation -- that someone has swindled the treasury -- does not seem to have occurred to him. What shall we do?"
byz_faction.a.57:0 "Blast! The gold must have transmuted"
byz_faction.b.57:0 "Traitors! Execute the Grand Secretary"
byz_faction.t.58:0 "Grand Secretary Howls at the Moon"
byz_faction.d.58:0 "Queer noises have been coming from the villa of one of the Grand Secretaries during the night lately, increasing in intensity and strength with each passing month. Initially you put it down to some intricate playtime with one of his concubines, but recently it has begun to dawn on you that there is a remarkable connection between the lunar phase and the noises. A spy sent into the garden on a full moon night returns with disturbing news: The Grand Secretary spends his nights standing in his garden, howling at the moon."
byz_faction.a.58:0 "Sha-la-la-la!"
byz_faction.b.58:0 "He has taken the law and thrown it away!"
byz_faction.t.59:0 "Tax Barge Sinks"
byz_faction.d.59:0 "Terrible news reach us from the Bosporus, where one of the Tax barges, carrying a substantial amount of the taxes for $YEAR$, has sunk during a particularly nasty bout of bad weather. The Grand Secretary of the Treasury interprets these events as a sign that our dynasty no longer enjoys the blessing of God, and argues that we must accept and respect this turn of providence. How shall we respond to these ill tidings?"
byz_faction.a.59:0 "Sigh. Not much to do, is there?"
byz_faction.b.59:0 "Mint to recoup the losses."
byz_faction.t.60:0 "False Edicts"
byz_faction.d.60:0 "Several provinces have reported to the capital that they are now in full compliance with several sets of new imperial edicts, the only problem is that you've never issued any such edicts. An investigation into the matter reveals that several forged bronze plaques with written edicts, bearing your seal, have somehow found their way to the province governors. It is a dark time when people dare challenge the Emperor openly. What shall we do about these false edicts?"
byz_faction.a.60:0 "Pretend that they are yours"
byz_faction.b.60:0 "Rescind them"
