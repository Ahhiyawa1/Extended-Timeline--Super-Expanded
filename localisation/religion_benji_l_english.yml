 cathar_religion_desc:0 "Catharism was a name most notably used as a designation for a group of dualistic sects of the later Middle Ages that thrived throughout Southern Europe, particularly northern Italy and southern France, between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries. The Cathars professed a neo-Manichaean dualism; that there are two principles, one good and the other evil, and that the material world is evil. Although the various groups emphasized different doctrines, they all agreed that matter was evil. Man was an alien and a sojourner in an evil world; his aim must be to free his spirit, which was in its nature good, and restore it to communion with God. There were strict rules for fasting, including the total prohibition of meat. Sexual intercourse was forbidden; complete ascetic renunciation of the world was called for. Under constant persecution by the Catholic Church, the Cathar hierarchy faded out in the 1270s. The heresy lingered through the fourteenth century and finally disappeared early in the fifteenth."
 rasenna_religion_desc:0 "The Rasenna faith reflects the ancient spiritual traditions of the Etruscan people, a civilization renowned for its wisdom, artistry, and connection to the divine. Rooted in the worship of a pantheon of gods, each embodying distinct aspects of life, the faith serves as a guiding force for its adherents. From governance to warfare, and from prosperity to daily rituals, the Rasenna faith unites the Etruscan people, preserving their legacy and strength against the tides of foreign influence and heresy; Etruscan polytheism at its finest"
 baptist_religion_desc:0 "Baptists are individuals who comprise a group of Christian denominations and churches that subscribe to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers (believer's baptism, as opposed to infant baptism), and that it must be done by complete immersion (as opposed to affusion or sprinkling). Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, pastors and deacons. Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches, though some Baptists disavow this identity."
 mormon_religion_desc:0 "Mormonism is the predominant religious tradition of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity. This movement was founded by Joseph Smith in Upstate New York in the 1820s. During the 1830s and 1840s, Mormonism distinguished itself from traditional Protestantism. Mormonism today represents the new, non-Protestant faith taught by Smith in the 1840s. After Smith's death, most Mormons followed Brigham Young on his westward journey to the Utah Territory, calling themselves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Variations not a part of the LDS Church include Mormon fundamentalism, which seeks to maintain practices and doctrines such as polygamy that were abandoned by the LDS Church, and various other small independent denominations."
 bogomilism_religion_desc:0 "Bogomilism was a dualist religiopolitical sect founded in the First Bulgarian Empire by the priest Bogomil during the reign of Tsar Peter I in the 10th century. It most probably arose in what is today the region of Macedonia as a response to the social stratification that occurred with the introduction of feudalism and as a form of political movement and opposition to the Bulgarian state and the church. The Bogomils called for a return to what they considered to be early spiritual teaching, rejecting the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and their primary political tendencies were resistance to the state and church authorities. This helped the movement spread quickly in the Balkans, gradually expanding throughout the Byzantine Empire and later reaching Kievan Rus', Bosnia, Dalmatia, Rascia, Italy, and France."
 hussitism_religion_desc:0 "The Hussites were a Christian movement following the teachings of Czech reformer Jan Hus, who became the best-known representative of the Bohemian Reformation and one of the forerunners of the Protestant Reformation. This predominantly religious movement was propelled by social issues and strengthened Czech national awareness. After the Council of Constance lured Jan Hus in with a letter of indemnity, then tried him for heresy and put him to death at the stake on 6 July 1415, the Hussites fought the Hussite Wars (1420–1434) for their religious and political cause."
 mandaenism_religion_desc:0 "Mandaeism (or Mandaeanism) is a gnostic religion with a strongly dualistic worldview. Its adherents, the Mandaeans, revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enos, Noah, Shem, Aram and especially John the Baptist, but reject Abraham, Moses and Jesus. The Aramaic 'manda' means 'knowledge', as does Greek 'gnosis'. Mandaeans appear to have settled in northern Mesopotamia, but the religion has been practised primarily around the lower Karun, Euphrates and Tigris and the rivers that surround the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, part of southern Iraq and Khuzestan Province in Iran. Today, there are thought to be between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans worldwide."
 ahmadiyya_religion_desc:0 "Ahmadiyya (officially, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community or the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama'a) is an Islamic religious movement founded in British India near the end of the 19th century. It originated with the life and teachings of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908), who claimed to have fulfilled the prophecies of the world's reformer during the end times, who was to herald the eschaton as predicted in the traditions of various world religions and bring about, by peaceful means, the final triumph of Islam as per Islamic prophecy. He claimed that he was the Mujaddid (divine reformer) of the 14th Islamic century, the promised Messiah and Mahdi awaited by Muslims. The adherents of the Ahmadiyya movement are referred to as Ahmadi Muslims or simply Ahmadis."
 mutazila_religion_desc:0 "Mu'tazila is a school of Islamic theology based on reason and rational thought that flourished in the cities of Basra and Baghdad, both in present-day Iraq, during the 8th–10th centuries. The adherents of the Mu'tazili school—known in the English language as 'Mu'tazilites'—are best known for their denying the status of the Qur'an as uncreated and co-eternal with God, asserting that if the Quran is God's word, logically God 'must have preceded his own speech'. After the 10th century, the movement declined. It is viewed as heretical by some scholars in modern mainstream Islamic theology for its tendency to deny the Qur'an being eternal, and to allow for the possibility of free will and thus opposing the strict determinism of mainstream thought."
 shaivism_religion_desc:0 "Saivam or Shaivism or Saivism is one of the four most widely followed sects of Hinduism, which reveres the God Shiva as the Supreme Being. They believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is. Shaivism, like some of the other forms of Hinduism, spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, including Java, Bali, and parts of the Southeast Asian continent, including Cambodia. Shiva is sometimes depicted as the fierce God Bhairava. Saivists are more attracted to asceticism than adherents of other Hindu sects, and may be found wandering India with ashen faces performing self-purification rituals. They worship in the temple and practice yoga, striving to be one with Shiva within."
 shaktism_religion_desc:0 "Shaktism or Shaktidharma is a denomination of Hinduism that focuses worship upon Shakti or Devi – the Hindu Divine Mother – as the absolute, ultimate Godhead. It is, along with Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Smartism one of the primary schools of devotional Hinduism and is especially popular in Bengal and Assam. Shaktism regards Devi as the Supreme Brahman itself, with all other forms of divinity, considered to be merely her diverse manifestations. In the details of its philosophy and practice, Shaktism resembles Shaivism. However, Shaktas (practitioners of Shaktism) focus most or all worship on Shakti, as the dynamic feminine aspect of the Supreme Divine. Shiva, the masculine aspect of divinity, is considered solely transcendent, and his worship is usually relegated to an auxiliary role."
 imperialcult_religion_desc:0 "The Imperial cult of ancient Rome identified emperors and some members of their families with the divinely sanctioned authority of the Roman State. The framework for the Imperial cult was formulated during the early Principate of Augustus, and was rapidly established throughout the Empire and its provinces, with marked local variations in its reception and expression. As Roman society evolved, so did cult to emperors: both proved remarkably resilient and adaptable. Until its confrontation by fully developed Christian orthodoxy, Imperial cult needed no systematic or coherent theology. Its part in Rome's continued success was probably sufficient to justify, sanctify and explain it to most Romans."
 mithraic_religion_desc:0 "The Mithraic Mysteries were a mystery religion practiced in the Roman Empire from about the 1st to 4th centuries AD. The name of the Persian god Mithra (proto-Indo-Iranian Mitra), adapted into Greek as Mithras, was linked to a new and distinctive imagery. Writers of the Roman Empire period referred to this mystery religion by phrases which can be anglicized as Mysteries of Mithras or Mysteries of the Persians; modern historians refer to it as Mithraism, or sometimes Roman Mithraism. The mysteries were popular in the Roman military. Worshippers of Mithras had a complex system of seven grades of initiation, with ritual meals. Initiates called themselves syndexioi, those 'united by the handshake'. They met in underground temples (called mithraea), which survive in large numbers. It has been estimated that there would have been at least 680–690 mithraea in Rome."
 numenism_religion_desc:0 "It is difficult to reconstruct early Roman religion which consisted of a mixture of native Latin, Etruscan, and Greek belief. Much of Etruscan religion and mythology became part of classical Roman culture, including the Roman pantheon. The Senate adopted key elements of their religion, which were perpetuated by haruspices (divination specialists) and noble Roman families who claimed Etruscan descent. Greek religion also impacted the Italian peninsula relatively early, adopted into the Etruscan system around 750 BC."
 neoplatonism_religion_desc:0 "In many ways, the mystical Neoplatonism of late antiquity represents the culmination of Greco-Roman religious thought. Drawing from traditional religious practice, mystery cults, orientalism, and the philosophical tradition, Neoplatonism (especially as formulated by Iamblichus) presented a final organized revival of traditional pagan practice in the Christian empire. The ritual aspect of Neoplatonism, theurgy, even served as the backdrop for Emperor Julian's revived paganism in AD 362, briefly gaining prominence akin to a state religion. Christianity ultimately reasserted itself as the dominant religion of the period, but this did little to lessen the impact of Neoplatonism on religious thought. The emanationist cosmology and divine hierarchies presented by Neoplatonism were taken up by Christian, Jewish, and Muslim theologians forming key components of later schools of mysticisms such as Kabbalah and Sufism. The rediscovery of Neoplatonic texts in the Renaissance would also inspire modern Hermetic and magic traditions."
 hermeticism_religion_desc:0 "Hermeticism, also called Hermetism, is a religious, philosophical, and esoteric tradition based primarily upon writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus (Thrice Great). These writings have greatly influenced the Western esoteric tradition and were considered to be of great importance during both the Renaissance and the Reformation. The tradition claims descent from a prisca theologia, a doctrine that affirms the existence of a single, true theology that is present in all religions and that was given by God to man in antiquity. Many Christian writers, including Lactantius, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Marsilio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Giordano Bruno, Campanella, Sir Thomas Browne, and Emerson, considered Hermes Trismegistus to be a wise pagan prophet who foresaw the coming of Christianity."
 atanodjuwaja_religion_desc:0 "The extent to which one must differentiate between Minoan and early Mycenaean religion is a difficult question. There is no doubt that Minoan culture would go on to influence the Greek world, and, as such, a degree of transmission is assumed. However, Minoan religion was not transmitted through its native language, and Minoan writing continues to remain largely undeciphered. Surviving Minoan iconography, in fact, more closely resembles the religions of the ancient Near East than those with Indo-European or Etruscan influence. However, the Minoans also appear to have practiced a matriarchal religion; primarily worshipping goddess. Although there is some evidence of male gods, depictions of Minoan goddesses vastly outnumber depictions of anything that could be considered a Minoan god. Several goddesses appear to be portrayed including a primary solar goddess (possibly linked to Athena), a mother goddess, a mistress of animals, protectors of cities and household, and underworld goddesses. Votive figures were often represented alongside serpents."
 dodecatheism_religion_desc:0 "Dodekatheism originated in and is practiced in Greece and in other countries. Leaders of the movement claimed in 2005 that there are as many as 2,000 adherents to the Hellenic tradition in Greece. Hellenic polytheists worship the ancient Greek Gods, including the Olympians, nature divinities, underworld deities (chthonic gods) and heroes. Both physical and spiritual ancestors are honored. It is primarily a devotional or votive religion, based on the exchange of gifts (offerings) for the gods blessings. The ethical convictions of modern Hellenic polytheists are often inspired by ancient Greek virtues such as reciprocity, hospitality, self-control and moderation."
 zoroastrian_religion_desc:0 "Zoroastrianism is one of the world's oldest religions. Ascribed to the teachings of the prophet Zoroaster, its Supreme Being is Ahura Mazda. Leading characteristics, such as messianism, the Golden Rule, heaven and hell, and free will influenced other religious systems, including Second Temple Judaism, Gnosticism, Christianity, and Islam. For a thousand years, forms of Zoroastrianism (including a Mithraic Median prototype and Zurvanist Sassanid successor) were the world's most powerful religion, serving as the state religion of the pre-Islamic Iranian empires from around 600 BCE to 650 CE. Zoroastrianism was suppressed from the 7th century onwards following the Muslim conquest of Persia. Recent estimates place the current number of Zoroastrians at around 2.6 million, with most living in India and Iran. Besides the Zoroastrian diaspora, older Mithraic faith like Yazdanism is still practised amongst the Kurds."
 vedism_religion_desc:0 "The religion of the Vedic period was a historical predecessor of modern Hinduism, though significantly different from it. Some scholars have compared the level of difference between Vedism and modern Hinduism as similar to the level of difference between Temple Judaism and modern Christianity. The religion of the later Vedic period co-existed with local religions and was itself the product of a composite of the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian cultures and civilizations. Vedic religion was followed by the Upanishads which gradually evolved into Vedanta, which is regarded by some as the primary institution of modern Hinduism. However, aspects of the historical Vedic religion survived in corners of the Indian subcontinent such as Kerala, where the Nambudiri Brahmins continue the ancient Srauta rituals considered extinct in all other parts of India."
 freemasonry_religion_desc:0 "Freemasonry consists of fraternal organisations that trace their origins to the local fraternities of stonemasons, which from the end of the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. The degrees of freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Apprentice, Journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason. These are the degrees offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as Freemasons or Masons. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees."
 pajelanca_religion_desc:0 "Pajelanca (from the Tupi word pajé, a form of shaman) is a generic term applied to various manifestations of shamanism found amongst indigenous peoples of the Amazon Rainforest Basin. Although specifics differ between the various indigenous tribes, most traditions center around the use of plant extracts in order to enter trances, contact spiritual entities, or for healing purposes. The pajé, then, acts as both doctor and priest. Typically, this knowledge is passed down from generation to generation and the responsibility of the pajé as a whole falls to the tribe. Some Tupi believe that pajé have a direct link with the gods as well as the various powers and non-human beings (ancestor spirits of both humans and animals), and by extension have the power of prophecy."
 angakkunngurniq_religion_desc:0 "The Inuit practiced a form of shamanism based on animist principles. They believed that all things had a form of spirit, including humans, and that to some extent these spirits could be influenced by a pantheon of supernatural entities that could be appeased when one required some animal or inanimate thing to act in a certain way. The angakkuq of a community of Inuit was not the leader, but rather a sort of healer and counselor, who tended wounds and offered advice, as well as invoked the spirits to assist people in their lives. His or her role was to see, interpret, and exhort the subtle and unseen. Angakkuit were not trained; they were held to be born with the ability and recognized by the community as they approached adulthood."
 chiminigagua_religion_desc:0 "Unlike the theocratic empires of Mexico and Peru, the fledgling Muisca state had no stone pyramids, temples, or sculpture. In common with the religions of other American theocracies, however, that of the Muisca placed special emphasis on the adoration of the sun. In Muisca cosmology, the supreme deity, Chiminigagua, was equated with light. Myth recounts how, in the beginning, darkness and silence reigned over a sterile world. Light existed only as the omniscient Chiminigagua within an impenetrable shell of clay. On the occasion of the first dawn, the god broke the shell and illuminated with beauty all that had previously been chaos. Complementing this dawn-creation myth is the legend of Bachue, fecund mother and matrilineal deity, who emerged from the waters to give birth to the people of the Muisca realm. The most notable example of Muisca religious practice to influence contemporary popular culture is perhaps the legend of El Dorado. El Dorado literally means 'the gilded one' in Spanish. The Zipa used to offer gold and other treasures to the Guatavita goddess. To do so, the Zipa covered himself with gold. This tradition was well-known outside the Muisca Confederation, as far as the Caribbean Sea. Imagined as a place, El Dorado became the kingdom of this legendary golden king."
 kachina_religion_desc:0 "A Kachina is a spirit being found in western Pueblo cosmology and religious practice, representing anything from a revered ancestor to an element, location, quality, natural phenomenon, or concept. Although not worshipped, kachina are viewed as powerful beings which, if given veneration and respect, can use their particular power for human good. Historically, the kachina religion predates European contact; however, it remains an open question among scholars as to whether the kachina religion was an indigenous creation or an import from Mesoamerica."
 mahoma_religion_desc:0 "Under the Calusa there was a standardized ritual cult, distinct from the Southern Cult, that was probably traditional and widely shared in South Florida. However, it is difficult to distinguish the political religiosity associated with state level worship and the traditional religion at the social bottom. The Calusa chief was understood as possessing special and traditional religious knowledge and held a council which may have included on more head priests."
 midewiwin_religion_desc:0 "The Midewiwin, or the Grand Medicine Society, is a secretive religion of the aboriginal groups of the Maritimes, New England, and Great Lakes regions in North America. Historians describe Midewiwin as a flexible, tenacious tradition that provided an institutional setting for the religious beliefs of the Ojibwe people. According to oral history, seven great Miigis (Iridescent Beings) appeared to the peoples in the Waabanakiing (Land of the Dawn) to teach them Midewiwin. One of them, the Thunderbird, was too powerful and forced to return to the ocean lest he kill the people in his presence. The other six Miigis remained to teach the people and each established the various clans, symbolized by animal, fish, or bird species. Other traditions, associate the founding of Midewiwin to Nanabozho or Mateguas, trickster figures commonly associated with the rabbit."
 orenda_religion_desc:0 "Iroquois religion is characterized by a dualistic belief in an all-powerful creator known as Hawenneyu, or Great Spirit, and his evil twin brother Hanegoategeh, or Evil-Minded. The Iroquois believe in the constant superintending care of the Great Spirit, yet knowledge of him is beyond human understanding. Honochenokeh, or Invisible Agents, are a series of intermediary lesser spirits which preside over individual objects or powers. The Iroquoian term Orenda, like mana, designates a power that is inherent in numerous objects of nature but that does not have essential personification or animistic elements. The ritual ceremonies practiced by the Iroquois tribes were systematic occurring in accordance to certain seasonal periods throughout the year. Festivals were led by Honundenont, or Keepers of the Faith, and most commonly occurred during important agricultural periods. Worship and thanks were given to the Great Spirit for protection and survival. Creation myths often involve the interplay between Hawenneyu and Hanegoategeh, as well as Atahensic, the Sky Woman. Hawenneyu was said to have planted a single maize plant in the body of his mother Atahensic. This plant was a gift to mankind. In many variants of the creation myth, Atahensic was a Sky Woman who fell to earth. She died in childbirth and her body fertilized the earth so that her granddaughters could grow many things. The Iroquois axis mundi existed as a form of Great Turtle who carried the world on the back of his shell."
 wakan_tanka_religion_desc:0 "In Sioux tradition, Wakan Tanka can be translated as the Great Spirit, or, perhaps more accurately, as the Great Mystery. The Sioux regard the universe as ultimately incomprehensible; life, growth, and death are mysterious and suggestive of powers difficult to understand. Since time itself does not embody notions of change and progress, nothing in the universe can be considered to be inevitable. This incomprehensibility and unpredictability of the universe, anything difficult to understand, is called wakan, which also connotes the animating force of the universe, the totality of which is Wakan Tanka. Wakan Tanka, then, can be understood as the sum total of the personified powers that brought all things into being; sometimes embodied as the Six Grandfathers."
 pohakantenna_religion_desc:0 "The religion of the Numic peoples of the Great Basin recognizes the central importance of power and energy; poha. Poha, as the central vivifying energy, has a great affinity for all living things. As water is the most vitally important component of living in the Basin, poha and water (paa) are closely linked. Poha is not understood to be static; it is dynamic and kinetic, underlying all aspects of the universe. As singing and dancing involve rhythmical movement not unlike the poha of the universe, both play a central role in controlling the flow of power. Large formal gatherings, such as the dancing circle, serve to concentrate poha in an area. Poha is also conferred by a spirit through a recurrent dream or vision. The individual can then use the power to benefit others, becoming a shaman (pohakanten), or for personal reasons; becoming a witch (dizipoha). Power in and of itself is merely a gift to man by one of the immortals, usually the ideal of an animal species, which has existed since the Timeless Age."
 southern_cult_religion_desc:0 "The major focus of Mississippian religion was the interconnectivity of all life, expressed predominantly through agriculture and extensive mortuary customs. Besides the use of platform mounds, a complex and elaborate system of iconography began to be expressed in the artifacts accompanying burials. Traditionally labeled as the Southern Death Cult, and in modern academia as the Southern Ceremonial Complex, this iconography can be seen in shell cups, copper plates, chipped and ground objects, stone statues, pottery, and more rarely in cave art. Besides a strong religious association, the Southern Cult represents a conflation of political, social, and economic aspects of Mississippian life."
 witran_mapu_religion_desc:0 "The spiritual belief of the Mapuche people is closely linked to the land and their natural environment from which the power of life emanates with the grace of a divine family known as Nguenechen, Elmapun, Elchen, and Ngunemapun, and which creates and sustains man and nature. The Mapuche people are guided by the machi, spiritual leaders (mainly women) who are the mediums of communication with the celestial family in order to maintain harmony and combat the malicious power of wekufe (evil). The Machi's supernatural power is complemented by the sacred kultrun drum they possess and play during their prayers and religious activities. The kultrun often depicts Mapuche cosmology; the earth divided by the four cardinal points. Modern Mapuche belief is highly syncretic incorporating elements from both Catholicism and Protestant movements."
 zemiism_religion_desc:0 "Indigenous Antillean religion, as recorded by late 15th and 16th century Spaniards, centered on a supreme creator god and a fertility goddess. The creator god was Yucahu Maorocoti, who governed the growth of cassava, the staple food of the islands, and the fertility goddess was Attabeira, who governed the moon, water, rivers, and seas. Religious worship centered on zemis, a term for both the gods themselves and for their physical representations, whether objects or drawings. Very small ceramic three-point zemis have been uncovered by archaeologists in the Lesser Antilles, as well as Colombia and Venezuela, dating back to 200 BC. Ancestral spirits were also highly honored, particularly those of chiefs. Bones or skulls might be incorporated into sculptural zemis. Ancestral remains would be housed in shrines and given offerings, such as food. Some zemis have been found accompanied by a small table or tray, which is believed to be a receptacle for hallucinogenic snuff called cohoba."
 sgaanaang_religion_desc:0 "The indigenous religious belief systems of the Pacific Northwest can be called animistic, whereby the natural world is animated by nature spirits which can influence the everyday lives of humans. These supernatural entities form relationships with lineage ancestors, becoming symbolically represented in the artistic tradition as crest animals. Cosmological notions find expression in complex oral traditions and knowledge of these and the animated natural world are still a vital component of modern belief. Of particular interest is the concept of the Transformer, usually embodied by the Raven or Coyote, who is considered the active earthly agent of the Creator."
 santeria_religion_desc:0 "Santería, (The Way of the Saints), also known as Lucumí, is the most common name given to a syncretic religious tradition of African origin that was developed in Cuba and then spread throughout Latin America and the United States. Santería was brought to Cuba by the people of the Yoruba nations of West Africa, who were enslaved in great numbers in the first decades of the 19th century. The name Santería derives from the correspondences made by some devotees between the Yoruba deities called orishas and the saints of Roman Catholic piety. As Santería developed from Yoruba theology, it is distinct from Voodoo and Palo, which developed from Fon and Bakongo theology respectively."
 heros_karabazmos_religion_desc:0 "Paleo-Balkan polytheism includes the religious practices of the Dacians, Thracians, and Illyrians. Due to a limited historical record, not much is known about the rituals and mythology of the Iron Age Balkans; however, elements can be gleaned from surviving statuary, neighboring Greek sources, and comparative studies. The mythology of the Illyrians is particularly unascertained, only known through mention of Illyrian deities on Roman period monuments. One notable cult, found throughout Thrace, Moesia, Illyria, and Scythia Minor is that of the Thracian Horseman. It is attested at Odessos by the Thracian name Heros Karabazmos and relates to an underworld deity usually depicted on funeral statues as a horseman slaying a beast with a spear."
 bird_figure_religion_desc:0 "The Vinca culture was a Neolithic archaeological culture in Southeastern Europe, dated between 5700-4500 BC. The culture is mainly distinguished by its settlement pattern and ritual behavior, maintaining a high degree of cultural uniformity through the long distance exchange of ritual items. Although there is evidence of potential proto-writing within Vinca culture, it is undecipherable. As such, details concerning Vinca belief must be inferred from archeological evidence; notably the abundance of ritual figurines."
 razana_religion_desc:0 "Approximately half of the country's population practice traditional religion, which tends to emphasize links between the living and the razana (ancestors). The veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the famadihana, whereby a deceased family member's remains may be exhumed to be periodically re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere. Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party, where food and rum are typically served and a hiragasy troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present. Consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to fady, taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. In addition, the Malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god, called Zanahary or Andriamanitra."
 amanaiism_religion_desc:0 "It is difficult to fully reconstruct the indigenous religious beliefs of the Berber people prior to the spread of Christianity and Islam into North Africa. As an Afro-Asiatic people, mythological and linguistic comparison with the Phoenician and Egyptian cultures is helpful as well as archeological evidence found throughout North Africa. However, the majority of written evidence concerning Berber religion comes from neighboring (particularly Greek and Egyptian) sources. Additionally, some ancient Berber beliefs continue to exist within modern Berber culture, albeit significantly altered."
 kemitism_religion_desc:0 "Kemetism (also Kemeticism, both from Egyptian kmt or Kemet, the native name of Ancient Egypt), also sometimes referred to as Neterism, Tameran Wicca, or Egyptian Neopaganism, is the contemporary revival of Ancient Egyptian religion and related expressions of religion in classical and late antiquity, emerging during the 1970s. There are several main groups, each of which take a different approach to their beliefs, ranging from eclectic to reconstructionistic. They include, but are not limited to: reconstructed Egyptian polytheism (adopting an academic and philological approach), Kemetic Orthodoxy (which adopts some elements of reconstructionism, but has a non-traditional henotheistic theology) and Neo-Atenism."
 odinani_religion_desc:0 "The traditional religion of the Igbo people, Odinani, is an ancient and complex monotheistic religion, although there are many spirits which serve as part of the overall religion. In its most basic form, the Odinani religion recognizes one God, named Chukwu (among other similar names) in the Igbo language. Like in the Abrahamic religions, Chukwu created the universe and everything in it. This Supreme Being, Ikekaike, is neither an ancestor nor a spirit, both fundamental parts of the religion. While not a physical being, they influence humanity in ways unknown."
 amatongo_religion_desc:0 "Zulu indigenous belief is primarily one of ancestor worship. The Zulu pray to the amatongo, the venerated ancestors, and the spirits of the dead in general are understood to be responsible for the care of the living, the community's wealth and cattle, and the harmony in the kraal. The Amatongo are in charge of bringing correction and balance to the community and are as much present in the homestead as the living members of the lineage. Communion with the spirits of the ancestors is perhaps the largest part of traditional Zulu culture performed through the ritual sacrifice of cattle."
 bumuntu_religion_desc:0 "Luba religion shares many basic tenets with other African religions including the existence of a Universal Creator (Shakapanga), the afterlife and a communion between the living and the dead, and the observance of ethical conduct (Mwikadilo Muyampe) as an essential condition for being welcomed in the village of the ancestors after death. Three primary figures constitute the supernatural world in Luba cosmology: Leza (Supreme God), Bavidye (nature spirits), and Bankambo (ancestors). Within the world of the living, the main figures are nsengha (priests), nganga (healers), and the mfwintshi (witches who embody evil and the antithesis of the will of the ancestors)."
 canaanite_religion_religion_desc_religion_desc:0 "Canaanite polytheism refers to the Ancient Semitic religions practiced in the Levant from at least the early Bronze Age through the first centuries of the common era. Notably, it was the religion practiced by the ancient Phoenicians who then disseminated it throughout their coastal colonies. Native Carthaginian religion is thus included within the broader heading of Canaanism. Central deities included: El, the most high; El's consort, Asherah; Ba'al Hadad, a storm god and the central cultic focus of later Canaanite thought; and Tanit, a lunar goddess and the patron of Carthage."
 fat_roog_religion_desc:0 "The traditional Serer religion represents the original religious beliefs, practices, and teachings of the Serer people of Senegal in western Africa. The Serer people believe in a universal supreme deity called Roog as well as lesser ancestral and nature spirits known as pangol. The village shrine, or xérém, was the nucleus of communal identity before colonization. It represents the intersection of nature, the spirit realm, and humanity, symbolically bridging the gap between human space (dëkk) and wild nature (àll) and bringing the spirit powers into the inhabited village. This communion is also profoundly local as pacts are between spirits and specific human communities and continue to sustain these communities. On a larger scale, a federation of villages could be called together for collective ceremonies in moments of crisis."
 itan_religion_desc:0 "The Yorùbá religion comprises the indigenous religion of the Yorùbá people, centered in Southwestern Nigeria and the adjoining parts of Benin and Togo. Yorùbá religious beliefs are part of Itan, the total complex of songs, histories, stories, and other cultural concepts which make up Yorùbá society. The Yorùbá hold that all human beings are expected to eventually become one in spirit with Olódùmarè (the divine creator and source of all energy). Daily life depends on proper alignment and knowledge of one's ori. Ori literally means the head, but in spiritual matters it is taken to mean an inner portion of the soul that determines àyànmô (destiny) and success. Ase is the life-force that runs though all things, living and inanimate. The thoughts and actions of each person in the physical realm interact with all other living things, including the earth itself. Each person attempts to find their àyànmô in the spiritual realm. The Orishas, the divine viziers and manifestations of Olódùmarè, represent intermediary and guiding divinities."
 laiboni_religion_desc:0 "The Maasai believe in one God, whom they call Ngai. Ngai is neither male nor female, but contains characteristics of both. There are two primary manifestations of Ngai. The good and benevolent black god, Ngai Narok, who shows goodness in water, rain, cattle, and children, and the angry red god, Ngai Na-nyokie, representing destructive water and sickness. In the beginning, Ngai was one with the earth and owned all the cattle that lived on it. But when the earth and sky separated, Ngai was no longer among men. The cattle, though, needed the material sustenance of the earth, so, to prevent them from dying, Ngai sent the cattle down to the Maasai and told them to look after them. Cattle retain an important role in ritual occasions, such as initiation and marriage, where their sacrifice bridges the gap between man and god. Even the grass used to feed cattle retains a semi-sacred aura and is used for blessings and as a sign of peace."
 num_faith_religion_desc:0 "The religious belief systems of the Khoikhoi and San peoples (Khoisan) of South Africa represent two distinct but interrelated traditions. In everyday activities, the Khoisan believe that one deity is the supreme creator and maintainer of life and earthly elements. This supreme god is a good one and its goodness is the focus of rituals and sacrifices. Yet, Khoisan religion is also highly dualistic: for every worshiper's belief in a particular high god, there is a converse evil god who is responsible for evil, war, sickness and death. For the Khoikhoi, the supreme god is called Tsui-goab and the destructive god is called Gaunab. The San combine both positive and negative aspects into one supreme god, Cagn, who takes on the role of a trickster figure. However, Cagn possesses many of the same characteristics as Tsui-goab with one notable difference being an expectation of immortality."
 nzambiism_religion_desc:0 "The indigenous religion of the Congo Basin represents a group of distinct but related traditional practices and cosmological concerns. Modern cosmology centers around Nzambi a Mpungu as supreme god and creator, although there is some debate regarding if Nzambi a Mpungu always held the position of supreme god or if it was a development in relation to the Christian God of Portuguese missionaries. Other categories include the bakulu (ancestors) and guardian spirits known as simbi."
 voodoo_religion_desc:0 "Vodun and its similarly named offshoot religions (Haitian Vodou, the Vudu of Puerto Rico, and Louisiana Voodoo) are primarily syncretic religions originating in West Africa and maintaining a strong foothold in the New World throughout the African diaspora. Vodun proper refers to an indigenous organized religion of coastal West Africa practiced by the Ewe, Kabye, Mina, and Fon people. It is distinct from the various traditional animistic religions found in the interior of West Africa away from the coast, and contains large elements of neighboring religions, such as traditional Yoruba theology."
 onyamesom_religion_desc:0 "The Ashanti believe in a pantheistic world of spirits, which pervade all matter - animate and inanimate - and control all actions and events. As unknowable and unapproachable, Nyame, the supreme god, is not worshipped in the traditional sense. He is approached through the ancestors and lesser spirits (abosom). However, even the abosom are understood as primarily utilitarian; they are beseeched and praised if they can provide good fortune, but can become the objects of contempt if they fail to do so."
 yazdanism_religion_desc:0 "Yazdânism is a neologism to denote a group of interrelated native Kurdish monotheistic religions: Yazidi, Yâresân, and Ishikism. The Yazdâni faiths were the primary religion of the inhabitants of the Zagros Mountains, including Kurds, until their progressive Islamization in the 10th century. These religions are highly syncretic, representing a combination of Zoroastrian, Manichaean, Jewish, Nestorian Christian, and Islamic elements."
 akattu_religion_desc:0 "Little is known about the indigenous religion of the Indus Valley Civilization. No religious buildings or temples have been identified, and most suppositions about sacrificial fires, cult objects, and deities rest on doubtful retrospective references from Hindu practices of many centuries later. Certain recovered figures have been interpreted as representative of an earth mother goddess. There is also the possibility of a bull cult reminiscent of Mesopotamia. The early period also supports the burial of the dead as opposed to cremation. Although one must be careful not to identify Indus and later Indian religions too closely, potential clues can still be drawn through comparative analysis."
 natib_quadish_religion_desc:0 "Natib Qadish is a modern polytheistic religion that venerates the ancient deities of Canaan and strives to understand the ancient cultural context and religious practices in which these deities were honored. Within Natib Qadish, there are various views, beliefs, approaches, and practices because much of the research is incomplete and scholarly theories differ widely."
 tjukurpa_religion_desc:0 "Tjukurpa is the Pitjantjatjara word for the Dreaming, a term within the animist creation narrative of indigenous Australians for a personal or group creation and for what may be understood as the timeless time of formative creation and perpetual creating. It is known in Yankunytjatjara as Wapar. The Dreaming can be seen as an embodiment of creation, which gives meaning to everything. It establishes the rules governing relationships between the people, the land and all things for Aboriginal people."
 manaism_religion_desc:0 "Indigenous Polynesian religion represents a group of distinct but related belief systems that exists across the various ethnic groups of the Polynesian Triangle. These belief systems often share many fundamental concepts, such as mana and tapu, and feature similar mythic cycles. The religion is polytheistic, believing in many deities, as well as animistic; spirits are also found in non-human beings and objects such as animals, the waves, and the sky. In Hawaii, the gods are known as atua, and the four most prominent deities, the ka ha, were Kane (the creator), Ku (war), Lono (agriculture), and Kanaloa (the sea). Cognates of these gods (Tane, Tu, Rongo, Tangaroa, respectively), held similar positions of prominence throughout the East Polynesian groups."
 puata_tupuna_religion_desc:0 "Eastern Polynesian religious practice is a testament to the increasingly more complex chiefdoms that began to develop within the Polynesian triangle. It can be understood as subset of larger Polynesia belief; distinct but related systems that share many fundamental concepts, such as mana (spiritual force) and tapu (spiritual restriction), and feature similar mythic cycles. Polynesian religion is polytheistic, believing in many deities, as well as animistic; spirits are also found in non-human beings and objects such as animals, the waves, and the sky."
 satsana_phi_religion_desc:0 "Satsana Phi (Religion of the Gods) is a term encompassing the indigenous ethnic religions practiced by the Lao, Thai, and Khmer peoples. These religions are pantheistic and polytheistic and often include shamanic roles. Satsana Phi is still widely practiced by approximately 30% of the population of Laos. The phi are primarily tutelary gods. In daily life, most people pay respect to the phi that reside in spirit houses, who are thought to protect the vicinity from harm. Offerings of flowers, incense, and candles are given, and the spirits are consulted during times of difficulty for protection and assistance. Guardian deities of places, such as the phi wat of temples, are celebrated with communal gatherings and offerings of food. The phi also include nature spirits, gods of Hindu derivation, and ancestor spirits. Malevolent spirits (phi phetu) include individuals who were bad in past lives or died of tragic deaths."
 yevon_religion_desc:0 "In Final Fantasy X, the people of Spira follow the Teachings of Yevon. The faith is named after Yu Yevon, a summoner who lived in Zanarkand one thousand years ago. Nearly all the peoples of Spira follow the teachings of Yevon, including the Ronso and the Guado (converted during High Summoner Braska's Calm by Jyscal Guado and Kelk Ronso). The Al Bhed are an exception and are viewed as heretics by the autocracy for their use of machina, a practice strictly forbidden by the church. As for the Hypello, whether or not they follow Yevon's teachings is never explored. The Yevon church draws inspiration from real-world religions, such as Shintoism (practices and temples), Buddhism (iconography and ritualistic disciplines), Islam (pilgrimages) and Catholicism (hierarchical structure and rigid doctrine)."
 crystal_religion_desc:0 "Throughout the Final Fantasy series, there have been instances of Gods, Goddesses and other divine beings. Divine beings often play an active part in the storyline, usually in the role of villain, but on other occasions, the Gods and Goddesses are only part of the game's mythology and background. They are mostly manifesting themwelves though crystals. Crystals have power over natural phenomena, and function as a powerful source of magical energy."
 okami_religion_desc:0 "Okami is an action-adventure video game developed by Clover Studio and published by Capcom. Set sometime in classical Japanese history, the game combines several Japanese myths, legends and folklore to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the Shinto sun goddess, named Amaterasu, who took the form of a white wolf. It features a distinct sumi-e-inspired cel-shaded visual style and the Celestial Brush, a gesture-system to perform miracles."
 penguin_religion_desc:0 "It is said that at the dawn of humanity, penguins tought emotions to mankind. They got relegated in Antarctica for obscure reasons, although many legends make mention of the gift of this continent which was far for them to live in peace and harmony, in rather awful climatic conditions but at least no one else would disturb them. However, the time has come for penguins to be venerated once again. After all, there is nothing more beautiful than cute fluffy penguin chick waddling on the ice!"
 disney_religion_desc:0 "Since the first adventures of Mickey Mouse in 1928, the Disney universe makes everyone dream. Over a hundred animated films were made, not including cartoons made for television. This universe continues to grow slowly but surely... And what if the Happiest place on Earth became a religion of its own? What if people decided to worship the most famous mouse in the world?"
 wicca_religion_desc:0 "Wicca, also termed Pagan Witchcraft, is a contemporary Pagan new religious movement. It was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and was introduced to the public in 1954 by Gerald Gardner, a retired British civil servant. Wicca draws upon a diverse set of ancient pagan and 20th century hermetic motifs for its theological structure and ritual practice. Wicca has no central authority. There are many variations on the core structure, and the religion grows and evolves over time. It is divided into a number of diverse lineages, sects and denominations, referred to as traditions, each with its own organizational structure and level of centralisation."
 south_arabian_religion_desc:0 "Information on the practice of religion in Arabia before the advent of Islam are rare. However, we know that the pre-Islamic religion was polytheistic, and varied by region. Many deities were identified with the sky, the stars, some stones and trees. Jinn and spirits were manifesting themselves in animal forms. The dead were surviving in a ghostly state."
 jainko_religion_desc:0 "The mythology of the ancient Basques largely did not survive the arrival of Christianity in the Basque Country between the 4th and 12th century AD. Most of what is known about elements of this original belief system is based on the analysis of legends, the study of place names and scant historical references to pagan rituals practised by the Basques. One main figure of this belief system was the female character of Mari. According to legends collected in the area of Ataun, the other main figure was her consort Sugaar. However, due to the scarcity of the material it is difficult to say if this would have been the central pair of the Basque pantheon. Based on the attributes ascribed to these mythological creatures, this would be considered a chthonic religion as all its characters dwell on earth or below it, with the sky seen mostly as an empty corridor through which the divinities pass."
 armenian_religion_desc:0 "The Armenian symbol of eternity is one of the national symbols of Armenia. This is a common and easily observable element in Armenian architecture, from ancient Armenian steles to khachkars. If Armenia was one of the first nations to convert to Christianity (several decades before Byzantium), the previous religion of the country was influenced by hellenism, adapting a part of the pantheon of the ancient Greeks."
 byeri_religion_desc:0 "Bwiti, or Byeri, is a spiritual discipline of the forest-dwelling Babongo and Mitsogo peoples of Gabon (where it is recognized as one of three official religions) and by the Fang people of Gabon and Cameroon. Modern Bwiti incorporates animism, ancestor worship, and Christianity into a syncretistic belief system. Bwiti practitioners use the psychedelic, dissociative root bark of the Tabernanthe iboga plant, specially cultivated for the religion, to promote radical spiritual growth, to stabilize community and family structure, to meet religious requirements, and to resolve pathological problems. The root bark has been consumed for hundreds of years in a Bwiti rite of passage ceremony, as well as in initiation rites and acts of healing. The experience yields complex visions and insights anticipated to be valuable to the initiate and the chapel."
 moai_religion_desc:0 "Moai, or mo‘ai, are monolithic human figures carved by the Rapa Nui people on the Chilean Polynesian island of Easter Island. Nearly half are still at Rano Raraku, the main moai quarry, but hundreds were transported from there and set on stone platforms called ahu around the island's perimeter. Almost all moai have overly large heads three-eighths the size of the whole statue. The moai are chiefly the living faces (aringa ora) of deified ancestors (aringa ora ata tepuna). The statues still gazed inland across their clan lands when Europeans first visited the island, but most were cast down during later conflicts between clans."
 imohag_religion_desc:0 "Before the arrival of Islam, the Tuareg people had a mythology of their own. Anigouran was one of their main deities. He appears in many stories transmitted by oral tradition. Anigouran is characterized by its exceptional intelligence and his taste for riddles. He is credited with the invention of tifinagh, the Tuareg alphabet, and scriptures using this alphabet were engraved on the rocks of the Air mountains."
 wakanda_religion_desc:0 "The Osage religion was pantheistic. All life forms and changes in the universe were the product of a single mysterious life-giving force called  Wa-kon-tah.  Humans were merely one manifestation of Wa-kon-tah. Clans were totemic, in that the members of a particular clan were more closely associated or linked to some manifestation of Wa-kon-tah than others. The Osage never claimed to fully understand this force and how it worked. There were spirits, and through visions humans communicated with them and gained their support. Some humans could turn themselves into animals. Power derived from supernatural knowledge was neither good nor evil."
 nazca_religion_desc:0 "Archaeologists, ethnologists, and anthropologists have studied the ancient Nazca culture to try to determine the purpose of the ancient geoglyphs located in southern Peru. One hypothesis is that the Nazca people created them to be seen by their gods in the sky. Some advanced a purpose related to astronomy and cosmology: the lines were intended to act as a kind of observatory, to point to the places on the distant horizon where the sun and other celestial bodies rose or set in the solstices. Many prehistoric indigenous cultures in the Americas and elsewhere constructed earthworks that combined such astronomical sighting with their religious cosmology, as did the later Mississippian culture at Cahokia in present-day United States."
 waldensian_religion_desc:0 "The Waldensians (also known variously as Waldenses, Vallenses, Valdesi or Vaudois) are a Christian movement and religious cultural group which appeared first in Lyon and spread to the Cottian Alps in the late 1170s. The movement originated in the late twelfth century as the Poor Men of Lyons, a band organized by Peter Waldo, a wealthy merchant who gave away his property around 1173, preaching apostolic poverty as the way to perfection. Waldensian teachings quickly came into conflict with the Roman Catholic Church. By 1215, the Waldensians were declared heretical and subject to intense persecution; the group was nearly annihilated in the seventeenth century and were confronted with organized and generalized discrimination in the centuries that followed."
 moism_religion_desc:0 "Mo or Moism, occasionally called Zhuang Shigongism, is the religion of most Zhuang people, the largest ethnic minority of China. It has a large presence in Guangxi. While it has a supreme god, the creator Bu Luotuo, numerous other deities are venerated as well. It has a three-element-theory (sky, earth and water). Mo is animistic, teaching that spirits are present in everything. Mo developed from prehistoric beliefs of the Zhuang people; it also has similarities to Chinese folk religion, and has developed similar doctrines to Buddhism and Taoism, in the process of competition with the influence of these religions on Zhuang culture. The Cultural Revolution of China weakened Mo, though the religion has undergone a revival since the 1980s. Moism varies from region to region."

Mwari's reverence dates back to the age of the ancient king Monomotapa, of the Mutapa Kingdom on the Zambezi River."
 jediism_religion_desc:0 "Jediism (or Jedism), is a nontheistic religious movement mainly based on the depiction of the Jedi in Star Wars media. Jediism attracted public attention in 2001 when a number of people recorded their religion as Jedi on national censuses, although most such submissions were thought to be protests or jokes. Although followers of Jediism acknowledge the influence of Star Wars on their religion, by following the moral and spiritual codes demonstrated by the fictional Jedi, they also insist their path is different from that of the fictional characters and that Jediism does not focus on the myth and fiction found in Star Wars. The Jedi follow the 16 teachings, which are based on the presentation of the fictional Jedi, as well as 21 maxims."

Lovecraft depicts Cthulhu as a gigantic entity worshiped by cultists. Cthulhu's anatomy is described as part octopus, part man, and part dragon. Its name was given to the Lovecraft-created universe where it and its fellow entities existed, the Cthulhu Mythos."

 daoism_religion_desc:0 "Daoism believes that one must live in harmony with the Dao, roughly translated as the 'Way.' Rejecting the unnatural aspects of government and society, Daoists believe in harmony with nature. Their desire to become closer with the natural world around them led many Daoists to become astrologists and alchemists, with the latter seeking the elixir of immortality. Despite its aversion to man-made institutions, Daoism has nonetheless influenced politics, governance and warfare in states across East Asia since it first emerged among the Chinese schools of thought during the Warring States period."
 waaqism_religion_desc:0 "Waaqism is the indigenous monotheistic faith of the Cushitic peoples - its followers worship the supreme sky god Waaq.

An Indo-Iranic, shamanistic religion, the Sarmatians' cosmology was headed by Tabiti, the foremost goddess of the primordial fire from which the universe was born.
