CHG_ideas:0 "Chagatai Ideas"
CHG_ideas_start:0 "Chagatai Traditions"
CHG_ideas_bonus:0 "Chagatai Ambition"
picking_up_the_pieces:0 "Picking up the Pieces"
picking_up_the_pieces_desc:0 "The pieces of Central Asia are scattered and attempting to unite different places under themselves, but from our vantage point, we can see that it is all futile. Chagatai power is no where near what it used to be, but we must not be complacent with this situation! Chagatai power must and will be restored whether it be by diplomacy or by military authority!"
unification_of_central_asia:0 "Unification of Central Asia"
unification_of_central_asia_desc:0 "The great Mongol Empire is long gone and so is its most notable successor, the Yuan Dynasty. What remains in the wake of this breakup is a mess of sorts, but nothing that we can't remedy with by properly asserting and enforcing Mongol authority once again. It will be a long journey, but Central Asia will be our foundation for greater ambitions."
modernize_and_adapt:0 "Modernize and Adapt"
modernize_and_adapt_desc:0 "The age of Khans and cavalry armies are fading into the distant past and it seems obvious that the age of kings and queens, emperors and empresses, and dukes and duchesses are upon us. Chagatai leadership will need to adapt to outside forces influencing our society and our administration by not simply holding onto the traditions of the past forever, but by attempting to reform certain parts of the nation and make peace with what new technologies and concepts lay ahead."
quick_and_vicious_movement:0 "Quick and Vicious Movement"
quick_and_vicious_movement_desc:0 "Part of the traditions we were left with from the times of the Mongol Empire was the notion of quick and efficient movement of armies, though, most of them back then were composed of cavalry. Even so, today we can impart these ideas on our current military and move from places to place, town to town, and fortress to fortress much quicker than our enemies can."
# mediate_buddhust_islam_encounters:0 "Mediate Islam and Buddhist Encounters"
# mediate_buddhust_islam_encounters_desc:0 "The paths through Central Asia are filled not with either fully Buddhist nor fully Islamic communities, though, they do come in contact with each other quite frequently in Chagatai lands. By helping the two religions converse and debate with each other in a peaceful manner, we can ease tensions within Chagatai lands when it comes to religious differences."
chagatai_enforcement_of_islam:0 "With Islam, there is Authority"
chagatai_enforcement_of_islam_desc:0 "The steppe in which we find the lives of our people play out in is spread out with villages and towns being mere small dots on vast swathes of open fields. This means that not only are government institutions weaker generally, but so are religious ones; the latter of which is something that we of the Chagatai Khanate rely heavily on to help control this land. If we can cement Islam more fully in these lands and bring forth more mosques and ulema members, our authority will only grow stronger with time."
silk_road_trade:0 "Silk Road Trade"
silk_road_trade_desc:0 "Trading with those of the Silk Road, even though it is far from what it used to be in the past, has helped the people of Chagatai prosper and learn of various ideas, including mercenary contracts. It should not be surprising that what we contribute to the Silk Road is also returned to us, just in a different and sometimes even better form, such as cheaper mercenaries."
reform_the_mongol_empire:0 "Reform the Mongol Empire"
reform_the_mongol_empire_desc:0 "The legacy is larger than life, some say; impossible to fully reclaim, as said by others. Ah, but these people do not know of the power within the Chagatai people, nor do they have the confidence. It will be a meticulous and time-consuming process, but through the blood of many and through times of both peace and war, those of the Chagatai nation will come to reclaim the mantle of the Mongol Empire!"
NOG_ideas:0 "Nogai Ideas"
NOG_ideas_start:0 "Nogai Traditions"
NOG_ideas_bonus:0 "Nogai Ambition"
confederation_of_turkic_and_mongols:0 "Confederation of Turkic and Mongol Tribes"
confederation_of_turkic_and_mongols_desc:0 "The Nogai Horde was originally a gathering and eventual confederation of about 18 Turkic and Mongol tribes. They formed a powerful and distinct force in the Pontic-Caspian steppe and presented a serious challenge to regional authority from the likes of the Golden Horde."
the_manghits:0 "The Manghits"
the_manghits_desc:0 "The Manghits were a Mongol tribe that formed a foundational core for our people. Edigu, one of our more well known leaders, was himself of Manghit origin on his father's side and of Jochid origin on his mother's side, giving him more legitimacy in the eyes of the Nogai people. The Manghits are thus not only inspirational, they have legitimized themselves within the region and within the Nogai tribes."
centralize_the_lesser_greater_nogay:0 "Centralize the Nogai People"
centralize_the_lesser_greater_nogay_desc:0 "We can almost see the problems coming on the horizon, for our spread out population will undoubtedly lead to administrative issues later on. The Nogai people in different areas with little to no communication to a central authority of the Nogai Horde will be on their own, subjects to whomever comes through and seizes power. We simply can't allow this to happen; there must be communication and access throughout our lands so that we can relay information to the furthest ends of our realm with ease."
weak_religious_institutions:0 "Weak Religious Institutions"
weak_religious_institutions_desc:0 "Though we are technically Islamic in our foundation, there are little in the way of Mosques or other formal worshipping places throughout our land. Thus, if one travels across Nogai territory, they might not even realize that its people and its administration are Islamic, making us inadvertently more tolerant to both heretics and heathens."
khanate_rivalries:0 "Khanate Rivals"
khanate_rivalries_desc:0 "There are several petty khans in the vast Eurasian steppe that claim authority with what little military forces they control. The Nogai Horde, however, can actively challenge these claims to authority and fight them over legitimacy on the steppe that we inhabit. There may only be one with absolute authority out in our homeland, all others are and will be either rivals or subjects!"
keep_nomadic_traditions:0 "Keep our Nomadic Traditions"
keep_nomadic_traditions_desc:0 "Our nomadic origins aren't easy to change or get rid of; the act of raiding and pillaging hostile land and bringing back loot to our tribes is something we inherited and something we cannot and will not simply give up."
fluid_political_organization:0 "Fluid Political Organization"
fluid_political_organization_desc:0 "Due to our spread out population and vast, open territory, politics in the Nogai Horde is much more akin to that of flowing water that rarely impeded by blockages, whereas we see kingdoms and empires around us that encounter countless issues with centralized governments and numerous advisors. If anything, the way we conduct our politics will help keep our people loyal and content."
OIR_ideas:0 "Oirat Ideas"
OIR_ideas_start:0 "Oirat Traditions"
OIR_ideas_bonus:0 "Oirat Ambition"
four_major_tribes:0 "Four Major Tribes"
four_major_tribes_desc:0 "The Oirat Horde is dominated by four tribes: the Dzungar, the Torghut, the Dorbet, and the Khoshut. The unification of these tribes means that military matters are able to be handled separately and with both grace and efficiency; we must work to keep these four united and working together so that our power does not wane."
memory_of_temujin:0 "Memories of Temujin"
memory_of_temujin_desc:0 "Temujin Ghengis made the world tremble before him and his cavalry, but before he ventured out of the region of Mongolia, he first had to contend with various Mongol tribes, such as those that now make up the Oirat Horde. We still hold the memories of the 13th century conquests as something to retrace and the legacy that it left behind, something to be tamed once more... Who else but the Oirat people could see to it that these memories are made a reality once more?"
ming_rivalry:0 "Ming Rivalry"
ming_rivalry_desc:0 "Our rivalry with the imposters down south, the so-called, 'Ming Dynasty', is nothing short of being on the verge of war at every moment. They desecrated and forced back our Mongolian relatives and now proclaim to be entering into an age of renewed strength, but little do they know that dissenters are spread far and wide throughout Zhongguo (China)! We will take these dissenters and rebels into our ranks and train them ourselves so that we may field them against the Ming Dynasty when war comes upon us."
fall_of_the_yuan:0 "Fall of the Yuan Dynasty"
fall_of_the_yuan_desc:0 "Founded by Kublai Khan in 1272 and driven out by the Red Turban Rebellion by 1370, then Yuan Dynasty was perhaps the greatest successor to the Mongol Empire established by Temujin. The Oirat Horde are the only serious claimant that might still hold enough power to retake the land the Yuan Dynasty once had. Should the heavens favor us in this endeavor, we can proclaim as the true successors to the Yuan Dynasty and forever seal away the likes of the Ming Dynasty."
past_the_great_wall:0 "Past the Great Wall"
past_the_great_wall_desc:0 "The Hongwu Emperor and the Yongle Emperor sought to rebuild and revamp the Great Wall in the late 14th century/early 15th century in order to keep the threat of us at bay, but we are nothing if not clever in finding ways around these defenses (or perhaps instead, through these defenses). We will innovate and adjust our tactics to ensure that these fortifications along the north do not stop the horde of cavalry from storming south into the heartland of Zhongguo."
religious_indifference:0 "Religious Indifference"
religious_indifference_desc:0 "If there is something to be said about religion in the Oirat Horde, it is that it is quite open and free from persecution. We have our own faith, but it is not expected of others to convert and learn of our traditions from the ground up, that would only instill unrest and distrust in people. Rather, a fair amount of religious indifference is key to keeping our people united."
unification_of_the_mongols:0 "Unification of the Mongols"
unification_of_the_mongols_desc:0 "The Mongols are not simply content with being divided up by foreign powers and pushed back to the steppe. The Oirat Horde retains the ambition to unite the several scattered Mongol tribes into one grand empire that can make the world bow beneath it, and it is the Oirat Horde that shall make this happen."
SHY_ideas:0 "Uzbek Ideas"
SHY_ideas_start:0 "Uzbek Traditions"
SHY_ideas_bonus:0 "Uzbek Ambition"
reign_over_many_tribes:0 "Rulership over several Tribes"
reign_over_many_tribes_desc:0 "The vast part of the steppe that we claim as the Uzbek domain is full of different tribes whose loyalty, at times, is questionable at best. They do, however, have connection toward different regions where different rulers and khans live; through these tribal ties, we can bolster our own name and reputation from the ground up."
degrading_golden_horde_influence:0 "Fall of the Golden Horde"
degrading_golden_horde_influence_desc:0 "Authority from the west is no longer what it used to be. The Slavic people of Muscovy and Novgorod are actively making attempts to take over what land was part of the Golden Horde, similar to us in the east. The waning authority also gives us more freedom to govern our realm as we see fit; we no longer need to pay tribute or service to a ruler from so far away in the west who was often dealing with much more pressing matters."
contest_over_southern_lands:0 "Southern Conflicts"
contest_over_southern_lands_desc:0 "Land in Transoxiana was always rightfully part of the greater Shaybanid domain, but the likes of Timur and his people contested these claims and sought to tear it away. If we are to keep our claim to being the rightful heir the Shaybanid domain, these conflicts in the south must result in Uzbek victory in time."
settle_issues_with_tribes:0 "Settle our Internal Issues"
settle_issues_with_tribes_desc:0 "The many tribes within the Shaybanid domain are not always peaceful and often times disputes between them, or disputes with them and the governing body, result in often bloody feuds that can destabilize entire parts of our nation. It is time that we organize formal places (buildings, perhaps) where representatives or leaders of tribes meet to discuss and mediate problems they have with each other. The results are bound to shed less blood, much less than prior ones before, at least."
consolidate_shaybanid_domain:0 "Consolidate the Shaybanid Domain"
consolidate_shaybanid_domain_desc:0 "The vast stretches of land we rule across have towns and villages dotting the landscape. They may be few and far between, but we can make them the starting points of proper Uzbek settlments that we can either properly tax or draft soldiers from. It is a matter of centralization over decentralization."
abulkharids:0 "The Abulkharids"
abulkharids_desc:0 "The Abulkharids are a distinct branch of the larger Shaybanid Dynasty and one of its most famous rulers, Abu'l-Khayr Khan, helped solidify Uzbek dominance across the larger Shaybanid domain. It is through the Abulkharids that we find a solid foundation for unity and strength, and it is by them that at least part of our people are held together."
ascend_from_nomadic_life:0 "Ascend from Nomadic Life"
ascend_from_nomadic_life_desc:0 "The way of the steppe nomads is not what is used to be. Increasingly there are institutions and nations propagating said institutions that chip away at the foundation of our ancestors way of life. Perhaps it is time for the Uzbek people to settle down and start a new life as a more agrarian people, rather than a nomadic people."
JIN_ideas:0 "Jin Ideas"
JIN_ideas_start:0 "Jin Traditions"
JIN_ideas_bonus:0 "Jin Ambition"
reaffirm_the_hukou_system:0 "Keep the Hukou System"
reaffirm_the_hukou_system_desc:0 "Though it has been used a very long time now, the Hukou System established so many generations ago is in tatters due to the disunity caused by the Ming Dynasty's decline. If we can utilize the old hukou registries of before to affirm taxation levels and conscription quotas, we will have a more solid foundation for a blossoming Jin state that takes after the Jin Dynasty of old."
#winners_of_the_three_kingdoms:0 "The Three Kingdoms Period"
#winners_of_the_three_kingdoms_desc:0 "Throughout the mid-2nd century, the Sima Clan made its way through the administrative structure of the dominant Wei Kingdom and effectively seized control of the throne of Wei in 266 via Sima Yan. After this, the Jin Dynasty became a dominant force in Chinese affairs and the last bastion of resistance, that of Eastern Wu, was conquered in 280. It is through this legacy that we again can rise to prominence and prestige should warfare fail us."
lodged_administrative_divisions:0 "Lodged Administrative Divisions"
lodged_administrative_divisions_desc:0 "A key feature of the Jin Dynasty was that of the administrative divisions developed by the Eastern Jin. They not helped govern some of the more hard-to-reach places of Southern China, but they also helped structure the government of the Jin Dynasty in a way that helped alleviate pressure from different internal sources. It would do us good to bring back these administrative divisions so that we too can profit from a more refined form of government."
channel_our_religious_energies:0 "Surging Buddhist Influence"
channel_our_religious_energies_desc:0 "Confucian ideas and priniciples mixed with Buddhist concepts and notions, that is what is coming to define this new Jin state born into an era of instability and uncertainty. By using Buddhist ideas whilst still adhering to Confucian principles at the state level, we can promote new philosophical ideas and insight into ideas that are truly groundbreaking."
#battle_against_former_qin:0 "The Former Qin"
#battle_against_former_qin_desc:0 "The Former Qin was the main opposition to the Eastern Jin from about 351 - 394, up until the Battle of the Fei River (383). Such a victory for the Jin Dynasty not only helped with legitimacy, but it also secured the rest of China from the imposters. We would do well to remember this battle and this victory well, for it was perhaps one of our greatest moments in history."
manipulation_of_taoism:0 "Manipulate Taoism"
manipulation_of_taoism_desc:0 "Taoism is often present in more rural communities around China, whereas Confucianism is seen to be present in the administrative structure of China. Just as our ancestors did, we should take a keen interest in Taoism and how it helps run these more rural societies for, if we can manipulate the people through Taoism (and vice-versa), we can ensure that our outskirts are stable and secure."
war_of_the_eight_princes:0 "War of the Eight Princes"
war_of_the_eight_princes_desc:0 "The period of civil rebellion from 291 to 306, known to us as the 'War of the Eight Princes', took place due to contention over the regency of Emperor Hui of Jin (he was developmentally disabled). Though this period was not filled with constant warfare as there was indeed periods of peace, it did cause a great amount of devasation to the heartland of the Jin Dynasty. We need to ensure that a succession struggle like this does not happen again and to mediate any future succession disputes before they reach our throne."
the_five_barbarians:0 "The Five Barbarians"
the_five_barbarians_desc:0 "Those that came through and overthrew the Western Jin, they defiled us once before but we will never let this happen again. The ensuing chaos that was partly caused by the invasion of the Five Barbarians resulted in the formation of the Eastern Jin and a subsequent loss in power for the Jin Dynasty as a whole, yet, we recovered from this and drove back the barbarians back toward the north. We must take this lesson from our past and keep it close to us and never again let those barbarians enter China again."
questions_on_immigration:0 "How to Handle Immigration"
questions_on_immigration_desc:0 "Much like the Jin Dynasty of old, we too must struggle with the constant movement of people from north to south, east to west, and in the reverse as well. Sometimes a natural disaster causes a massive influx of immigrants from the north to the south or vice versa, what then are we to do about these peasant and influential families that just get up and move? We must track them down and ensure we know what roads they are taking and where they settle in! By being more astute with this record keeping, we can assure a more cogent and scrupulous administration."
#zhongguo:0 "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
#zhongguo_desc:0 "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."
SHU_ideas:0 "Shu Ideas"
SHU_ideas_start:0 "Shu Traditions"
SHU_ideas_bonus:0 "Shu Ambition"
ancient_shu_state:0 "Ancient Shu State"
ancient_shu_state_desc:0 "Long ago, the people of the Sichuan Basin formed an independent kingdom and remained independent up until they were annexed by the Qin state (precursor to the Qin Dynasty). Our people have not forgotten that their heritage stretched so far back and is distinct from those outside of the Sichuan Basin nor have others around China, though the blending between Sichuan culture and Han culture has become a concrete fact that we live with to this day. In essence, the Shu state can be said to be a continuation of an ancient and ongoing cultural blending of sorts."
shu_han:0 "Shu Han"
shu_han_desc:0 "Liu Bei of the Three Kingdoms period declared the state of Shu the rightful successor to the Han Dynasty, giving it more legitimacy in the eyes of those who were loyal to the Han Dynasty at the time. We have not forgotten this proclamation and even though the Han Dynasty is but a mere chapter in the history of China, we still see ourselves as the rightful and legitimate rulers of China."
three_kingdoms_period_shu:0 "The Three Kingdoms Period"
three_kingdoms_period_shu_desc:0 "Pivotal in the history of the Sichuan people and the state of Shu in general, the Three Kingdoms period saw the establishment of an independent Shu state by Liu Bei in 221. It was here that Shu was immortalized into history and it is here from which we today draw inspiration, unification, and lessons from."
ample_supplies_of_shu:0 "Food, Water, Wood, and Metal"
ample_supplies_of_shu_desc:0 "Building up our heartland through renewed farms, new irrigation techniques, expansive mines, and regulated logging has led to a steady influx of resources over time. Much like how previous Shu states found ample supplies in the Sichuan Basin alone, we too will find all that we need to rise up through the ranks of the Middle Kingdom in this basin alone."
#zhuge_liang:0 "Zhuge Liang"
#zhuge_liang_desc:0 "After the death of Liu Bei in 223, his heir, Liu Shan took to the throne at age 16 with Zhuge Liang and Li Yan as regents overseeing most of the administration. Zhuge Liang in particular took control of most matters and attempted to put the Shu state in a better position against the domineering Wei state via aggressive expeditions from 228 to 234. Though none of the expeditions resulted in major changes on the political or military stage, the endurance and cunning that Zhuge Liang displayed as well as dedication to the Shu state is something all of us admire and strive to emulate."
defensive_position:0 "Defensive Position"
defensive_position_desc:0 "The geography of the Sichuan Basin makes it ideal for defending. This was clearly evident during the Three Kingdoms period since attacks from Shu required more effort and resources as opposed to defensive encounters. We would do well to remember this fact and fortify our defenses where and when possible."
connections_through_trade:0 "Trade Connections"
connections_through_trade_desc:0 "A key fact of the Sichuan Basin and when the Shu state came to prominence in the early to mid-3rd century was the conenctions through trade. South and west of the Sichuan Basin lay divided land that is tough to subjugate, but lucrative in trading opportunities. We need not always conquer places that provide us with wealth and resources, for they will soon bow to the people of Shu in time. Benevolence is something that is to be strived for, not ruthlessness."
supplies_for_any_situation:0 "Rectified Logistics"
supplies_for_any_situation_desc:0 "Though trade and production are flourishing over time in the Sichuan Basin, the Shu state's administration is lacking in efficiency compared to other neighboring states. If we can cut down on excess expenses and focus on logistical reforms so that we know what is going where and how long it may take, we will be able to cut down on logistical expenses as a whole."
WUU_ideas:0 "Wun Ideas"
WUU_ideas_start:0 "Wun Traditions"
WUU_ideas_bonus:0 "Wun Ambition"
history_of_independence:0 "History of Independence"
history_of_independence_desc:0 "The history of the region that is Wu and its independence stretches to before the 10th century BC. Military history as well as political and diplomatic history was forged both inside of and on the borders of the Wu region, leading to a fairly well defined sub-culture of China that still surges with power."
waters_of_wu:0 "The Waters of Wu"
waters_of_wu_desc:0 "The coastal waters are where much of the imports and exports of Wu go through. As such, it is only natural that we seek to protect these waters with a robust and large navy that can sail through deep waters, not just rivers."
three_kingdoms_period:0 "The Three Kingdoms Period"
three_kingdoms_period_desc:0 "The Three Kingdoms period was perhaps one of the most defining periods in the history of the Wu region since it marked it's last echo of independence until the 10th century AD. The military, cultural markers, and societal aspects of this time period are not lost on our people and we will continue to bask in the glory that was Eastern Wu."
promote_coastal_trade:0 "Promote Coastal Trade"
promote_coastal_trade_desc:0 "The ports of Wu grow in size and importance as time goes on thanks to our various investments of time and materials. Some of the most important ports in China are found in our land, so why not capitalize on it and help grow our revenue sector via larger markets and better docks?"
five_dynasties_ten_kingdoms_period:0 "The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdom Period"
five_dynasties_ten_kingdoms_period_desc:0 "The state of Wuyue, founded in 907 by Qian Liu, was perhaps the most powerful of the southern states of this chaotic time period after the Tang Dynasty. During its independence until 978, many infrastructure projects were put into motion and the land of Wu was greatly developed, leading to even more value coming to the region."
sea_bound_connections:0 "Wet Connections"
sea_bound_connections_desc:0 "Though we have ambitions across different stretches of land in the Middle Kingdom, we cannot deny that several connections we make across the water are lucrative and tempting to capitalize on. The more we negotiate and secure these foreign trade deals for the Wu state, the more we will see that trade can become a true lifeblood for us."
a_two_sided_state:0 "The Two Sided State"
a_two_sided_state_desc:0 "Whereas other states across the Middle Kingdom may rely on trade across roads and rivers, we know that the vast, open seas calls to the state of Wu. We will never let our mainland provinces fall into disarray, but we must continue to secure our mercantile ambitions across the water."
#the_sun_dynasty:0 "The Sun Dynasty"
#the_sun_dynasty_desc:0 "True to our history, the Sun Dynasty of the Three Kingdoms Period held the dominant position despite succession struggles clouding the future of Wu. It is through the continuation of the Sun Dynasty that Wu will prosper and maintain itself as a grand and propserous region in China."
CHC_ideas:0 "Chu Ideas"
CHC_ideas_start:0 "Chu Traditions"
CHC_ideas_bonus:0 "Chu Ambition"
the_in_between_buffer_lands:0 "Between the North and South"
the_in_between_buffer_lands_desc:0 "Back before even the Han Dynasty was around, the area surrounding Changsha was inhabited by the Yue people who had the established Nanyue Kingdom. Though the influence of the Yue people is tiny today, this region we call home today was known as a border region between those of the Middle Kingdom and those of the Nanyue Kingdom. Such a valued yet precarious position from the past lends our state of today a strong sense of political and diplomatic history that other states are very much aware of."
uphold_yuelu_academy:0 "Yuelu Academy, Rebuilt!"
uphold_yuelu_academy_desc:0 "Built and burned down time after time, the Yuelu Academy that was first initiated under the Song Dynasty is but a mere shadow of what it once was. Yet, Chu as a whole benefits from the students that attend and graduate from Yuelu Academy, meaning that as we patronize the academy with more funding and resources, it will be able to educate more and more Chu citizens as time goes on."
in_memory_of_the_tanzhou_protectors:0 "Remember the Defense of Tan Prefecture"
in_memory_of_the_tanzhou_protectors_desc:0 "The echoes of Chu's past can be heard all across history, yet one moment that stands out to us was during the fall of the Song Dynasty to the Mongols of the north. The defense of Tan Prefecture (a previous name for our home region) was so ingrained with loyalists of the Song Dynasty that once all hope was lost, the defenders committed mass suicide instead of being captured. It may be a dismal end to their story back then, but such a righteous and unyielding defense is what we should strive for in the face of imminent invasion."
emphasize_rice_production_in_chu:0 "Greater Rice Production"
emphasize_rice_production_in_chu_desc:0 "The fertility of Changsha and its surrounding areas... Valued by many, is it not? Truly the production of crops in our home region is something that many parts of the Middle Kingdom envy, yet they too are stepping up their irrigation measures to compete with us. Thus, let us double-down on our efforts to refine our agricultural practices! The more rice we can produce (alongside other crops of course), the more people we can feed and the more we will stand out as the food capital of the entire Middle Kingdom!"
control_of_the_xiang_river:0 "Control the Xiang River"
control_of_the_xiang_river_desc:0 "A central artery to the Chu state that isn't manmade is the Xiang River. It has been very influential in shaping the history of the region as a whole and we are still using it to benefit our state to this very day. Land distribution around the river being redone and using new technologies to improve the functionality of the river and its surrounding land will only serve to make the Xiang River even more integral to our success."
revere_the_ancient_past_of_chu:0 "Looking to the Ancient Past"
revere_the_ancient_past_of_chu_desc:0 "Scattered across Chu's heartland are ruins and isolated tombs that were once part of states that called this region home. Yue people, folks from the Chu state during the Spring and Autumn Period, and even tombs from others across various major dynasties, there are several historical artifacts both big and small that we can find and preserve if we dedicate the time and effort to do so. We should never forget our history no matter how ancient it is, for it is that very history that helped shape what we are today."
of_a_higher_educational_level:0 "More Schools; More Universities"
of_a_higher_educational_level_desc:0 "In order to better learn about our ancient past, to better facilitate a strong administration, and to cultivate a more literate population as a whole, all of these goals require one thing in common: educational centers. Schools, libraries, universities, or even temples where monastic education can take place, all of them to some degree must be funded by the Chu state more so as time goes on so that every other facet of the state can be strengthened. Empowering the people with knowledge can lead to heights unknown if we manage things correctly."
#foundation_in_myths:0 "Foundations in Myths"
#foundation_in_myths_desc:0 "From the legends in Sima Qian's 'Records of the Grand Historian', the royal family of Chu was descended from the Yellow Emperor (also known as Huangdi) and his grandson/successor Zhuanxu. Though the tale of the royal family's birth is longer than this in its entirety, our connections to traditional Chinese myths and deities gives us prestige in the eyes of those in and outside our state."
#control_over_central_china:0 "Control over Central China"
#control_over_central_china_desc:0 "The fertile region of Central China holds plenty of potential for agriculture, and a large population by natural consequences. Chu's foundation in the region makes it ideal for expansion by fielding a large military from places that are easier to develop and manage. We must keep in line with this way of thinking and continue to build up urban centers throughout Chu so that we do not falter in our military or economic potential"
#the_spring_autumn_period:0 "The Spring and Autumn Period"
#the_spring_autumn_period_desc:0 "The decline in authority from the Eastern Zhou throughout the latter 700's BC was the rallying call for the Chu state and many others. As authority from the court in Luoyi declined (having already been in a downward spiral since the invasion of the Quanrong prior to 771BC), power in the hands of smaller states grew immensely to the point where the they would wage wars against each other for hegemony and pay little attention to the Eastern Zhou. It is here that Chu gained its strength and passion to fight for itself, both of which we have not lost."
#take_on_gov_corruption:0 "Take on Government Corruption"
#take_on_gov_corruption_desc:0 "One aspect of the government of Chu was how corrupt it was at times. Administrators in both the military and the government were often doing secret deals or taking bribes that none could stop. If we are to be successful in our administrative tasks and military organization, there needs to be a stricter stance on corruption and more severe punishments for those found responsible for corrupt ties."
#qin_chu_rivalry:0 "Qin-Chu Rivarly"
#qin_chu_rivalry_desc:0 "Our most ardent and deadly rival was the legalist state of Qin. Though we were larger than they were in both military size and territorial size, they were much more disciplined and administratively focused; our ancestors simply could not compete against them and fell in them in about 223BC. Now that we are resurgent, we would do well to reform our military and practice proper discipline within so that any rivals to our power won't win so easily. The legalism can come later."

Sure, our arts and crafts were truly unique and our culture was flourishing, but this relaxed nature will lead to inefficient societies that lead further into decadance, something that most assuredly happened to our ancestors. There can be art and pleasure in our culture, but Chu must remain an efficient and robust state at all levels."

#reform_coin_minting_desc:0 "Though coins are minted in other places of Morocco, we began to strike our own coins during the Almoravid Dynasty's reign (specifically in 1092). By keeping up with this and paying close attention to the circulation of coinage throughout Marrakesh and its nearby cities, we can better control inflation and by extension, our own economy."

#attracting_new_scholars_desc:0 "Scholars have at times flocked to Morocco and settled within the various cities to promote innovation and technological understanding, but recently there has been a lack of that despite Marrakesh's mere existence. We must change this and initiate programs to attract scholars from across the regions around us so that they can bring a revitalized scientific effort back into the heart of Marrakesh and by extension, Morocco."

#sustain_the_kasbah_of_marrakesh_desc:0 "The citadel fortress of Marrakesh was built by Abu Yaqub Yusuf, the second Almohad Caliph. It's various gates and garrison points and overall structure makes Marrakesh a rather imposing and tightly guarded city, fit to be true and proper capital for Moroccans everywhere. Maintaining and slowly building it up over time will only serve to better defend ourselves when invaders are at our door."

#imperial_capital_once_more_desc:0 "The four traditional imperial capitals of Morocco (Fez, Meknes, Rabat, and Marrakesh) are all great in their own right and favored for one reason or another by various dynasties and families, but Marrakesh is becoming a true cut above the others. Prosperity is rising, the population is revitalized like never before, and few if any cities in Morocco can rival the influence of Marrakesh. It is time that is becomes the true capital of the region, of the Daughter of the Desert."

storied_history_of_marrakesh_desc:0 "The story of Marrakesh goes back to the days of Abu Bakr ibn Umar, a close relative of the Almoravid ruler Yusuf ibn Tashfin. Though our glorious city has seen a great deal of hardships since its founding the mid-1000s, the story that is told by its iconic red walls, its impressive mosques, its humble gardens, and its awe-inspiring tombs are visible for all to see. Few can forget what impact the rulers of the past had from their seat of power in Marrakesh."

further_the_souks_of_our_domain_desc:0 "Whereas other places try to regulate their marketplaces and merchant quarters with strict scrutiny, Morocco as a whole finds these market regulations more of a hinderance than anything. Though we are not keen on seeing these places go completely unguarded and without rules or guidelines, having a more fluid and casual commercial atmosphere in towns and cities has yielded more business for us as time has gone on."

exerting_influence_from_the_old_capital_desc:0 "Many remember the days before the Banu Marin rose to power and before power in Morocco became decentralized. The history of the Almoravids and the Almohads are remembered fairly clearly in the minds and texts scattered around Marrakesh, and it is the legacy of these now fallen states that we have been trying to emulate. Those in Fez, Ifni, and Tafilalt might laugh at our attempts to exert influence over their cities and towns, but their citizens remember distinctly the power and prestige that comes with hailing Marrakesh as their true capital."

Tribal feuding has left a great deal of Marrakesh without a sense of purpose and depopulated, but our efforts as of late have proven to give Marrakesh some life; perhaps revamping the kasbah and reinforcing its walls as well as its garrisons will further revive Marrakesh's grandeur."

remade_out_of_tribal_feuding_desc:0 "The various tribes and groups of tribes in the region have tried to seize control over politics in any number of ways, almost all of which chipped away at any notion of central authority in Morocco as a whole. Marrakesh in particular has been a victim of these tribal feuds such that the Banu Marin have not been able to exert proper authority over the city for a long time. It is in the dire times that the populace has learned to always be on guard, spears and muskets at the ready."

What makes Marrakesh stand out are the tombs of several Muslim figures that have been pivotal in Moroccan history so far, ranging from the Sunni theolgian and historian Qadi Iyad to the locally famous writer known as al-Suhayli. The final resting place of these great figures being within Marrakesh gives us a great deal of religious authority, especially when our imams draw on the old works written by them."

guardians_of_a_new_moroccan_era_desc:0 "In order for Morocco to be whole again like how it was under the Idrisids, Almoravids, or Almohads, there must be a strong city by which the region revolves around. Some would say that Fez should be that city since Marrakesh has been in decline for generations after the arrival of the Banu Marin, but we can and will prove through military might and a righteous administration that Marrakesh is more than worthy of being the capital of the region like it was in the past."

Now though, there is no Muslim nation to properly claim the title of 'Caliphate' and thus, the spot is vacant.

Though he did fulfill the oath, it was only for a brief time as it was undone not long after his death.

Even to this day we have more issues with feuding families as opposed to opposing theological claims which is exactly how it should be.

Even as we have grown and shrunk in size, the candi that are scattered around Java and nearby islands still hold great significance to a great many people; some hold the remains of loved ones, others are used for religious worhsip, and some are used for both.

Hayam Wuruk, the ruler of Majapahit, wanted to marry Dyah Pitaloka of Sunda and it was going to happen until Gajah Mada took the chance to demand the submission of Sunda to Majapahit. Such humiliation and anger resulted in a short skirmish that saw several die including Dyah Pitaloka; after our abhorrent defeat there in 1357, we have had to always be on guard for whatever may happen between us and the other side of Java."

Said pockets of no central authority are being filled with Muslim communities that are rather keen on converting both the Hindu and Buddhist communities across Java, meaning that Sunda itself is slowly becoming a religious island of Hinduism and Buddhism in a sea of Islam.

Trade along the Rhine River, that's what! We have been strengthening our ties to the Hanseatic League to the north for quite some time and now and even though times have changed, we still have a plethora of trade deals going on with the northern cities despite whatever the emperor wishes.

Theological arguments don't exactly hold up when say, a feud rises up between powerful trade guilds or grandiose nobles; what works then is summoning forth the military of Mainz which has traditionally been quite lacking. What we need to do in order to prepare for the future is to start building up a military that can keep the peace in our domain and, if our allies should so desire, their domain as well.

Still though, the efforts we have made so far to reform our own military ranks in the wake of internal struggles has led to a stronger push for reform in the Mainzer government as a whole.

Despite those early challenges though, our state has overcome more adversity than one might think across the centuries and it is through those past hardships that we look to reformation for the future. A more cogent, capable, and centralized sultanate that can uphold its own values in an ever changing world."

buffer_state_desc:0 "Dulkadir is seen merely as a buffer state in the midst of the 15th century, but there is potential in us hidden deep within. In order to draw that potential out, however, we will need time and resources and in that time, there will be those who want to put a sword to our throat, slashing with mercy.

seat_of_the_avignon_papacy_desc:0 "The memory lives on from when Avignon was the seat of power in the Catholic Church. The curia itself was moved to Avignon on March 9t, 1309 and until 1403, it remained a prime contestant for Papal power as the Papal Schism went on. Too many are forgetting when we were triumphant and powerful... Soon they will remember what made our city grand, and the people of Avignon, revered."
avignon_exchange:0 "The Avignon Exchange"
avignon_exchange_desc:0 "As one of the first sites of a foreign exchange market, we take pride in retaining this title and the luxuries that came with the Avignon Exchange. Not only did it promomt trade, but money lenders also found themselves at home here and with them on our side, securing beneficial loans and monetary advances will be all the more easier for us."

renovate_and_keep_the_palais_des_papes_desc:0 "Though not in use by the Papacy anymore, the palace and fortress her still serve important purposes for Avignon as a whole. Displaying our opulence and wealth and willingness to defend our land, renovating the Palais des Papes and keeping it in working order will undoubtedly help us learn how to fortifiy and keep our other lands outside of Avignon safe."

papal_library_and_the_university_of_avignon_desc:0 "The papal library and University of Avignon are some of the greatest works we have still after the fall of the last Anti-Pope, Benedict XIII. Retaining the knowledge that both produced and keeping them functioning for the city and the administration is of the utmost importance to us and Avignonese society as whole."
build_upon_previous_developments:0 "Building upon our Developments"
build_upon_previous_developments_desc:0 "The previous developments within Avignon, whether they be in terms of infrastructure to help bolster our society or administrative measures to assert our authority, must be constantly compounded upon for better and more lasting results. We must work things harder, make things better, do things faster, so that we, of Avignon, are stronger."

revenge_for_the_papal_schism_desc:0 "The great Papal Schism that once empowered Avignon as a place of grandeur and wonder may be over now, but the scar it left on us is not forgotten.

reassert_and_compound_on_the_norman_charter_desc:0 "The Norman Charter of 1315 was the one piece of legislation that kept Normandy afloat and at least somewhat independent of royal authority, especially during that time period since authority from the French in Paris was faltering. We will take to the Norman Charter and refine it over time, building upon what administrative qualities it instituted into Normandy itself."
empower_norman_administrators:0 "Empower Norman Administrators"
empower_norman_administrators_desc:0 "Keeping in line with our independent nature, we will be using more Norman administrators in our government than French ones. Those of Paris and the central part of the French region can keep to their houses and manors, the Norman people will be the ones put in charge as only they can judge and rule Normandy correctly. Once they are set in Normandy though, perhaps they can help our other lands become more centralized too? We can only hope and try."
channel_ambitions:0 "Channel Ambitions"
channel_ambitions_desc:0 "The Channel is one the key body of water we need to be concerned with as it holds access to the lands of the Isles and our own coasts. Trade goes into and out of the Channel and it would do us good to make sure that these routes of trade are secure for the Norman people, as opposed to others around us."

cohesion_in_the_deccan_desc:0 "Our position in the region known as the Deccan is tenuous and subject to influence from seveal different shahs and rajas around us.

setup_forges_and_foundries_desc:0 "Incoming foreigners occasionally bring with them strange weapons they call 'firearms' that use and explosive powder called 'gunpowder'. Though some are reluctant to use such weapons, our engineers and military officers are keen on seeing how they perform in combat against our enemies; some of the wealthy individuals from our military are even willing ot put up the money to start producing such weapons inside Berar. Since it is isn't our money going into these facilities, why stop them from being built?"
modernizing_weaponry:0 "Modernizing our Weapons"
modernizing_weaponry_desc:0 "The age of warfare is changing all throughout India and beyond. Slowly but surely the enemies around Berar are gaining these weapons too, thus making the battlefield equal once more. We don't need this, we need to make it favored to us once again throughout investments into new military technology and refinements in our current military weapons."
fortification_artillery:0 "Fortification Artillery"
fortification_artillery_desc:0 "Fortifications around Berar are fine on their own, but they lack the punch to retaliate against our enemies when they come under siege. If we begin to use artillery from defensive positions from our fortifications against besieging armies, perhaps we can also use this knowledge later on when we other armies in battle? Field artillery is something of great interest to our military officers and perhaps investing in the concept now will pay off later for Berar."
reforming_the_succession_of_berar:0 "Reforming the Berari Succession"
reforming_the_succession_of_berar_desc:0 "We must not focus purely on one aspect of Berar and neglecy others, especially when we can see the crumbling of various dynasties around us from time to time. We must take to reforming the succession laws of Berar and instituting more refined and strict rules regarding which heir is eligble for the throne so that in the future we can avoid succession struggles."
meritocratic_military_organization:0 "Merit over Blood"
meritocratic_military_organization_desc:0 "The time has come for us to phase out the aging method of nobles leading our armies into battle. Too many times has Berar seen its good men cut down by a leader who was supposed to be bright and capable because he was born of a grand family tree, no, this must change for the Berari military. There will be military academies set up and there will be skill-based recruitment of commanders; the nobles deserve less than we give them."
sustain_ourselves_from_aggression:0 "Sustain Ourselves from Aggression"
sustain_ourselves_from_aggression_desc:0 "The rivals around us show no signs of resting, and neither do we. For decades now, the Berari people have focused on outward expansion and neglected to think of their own safety and their own walls that should keep them safe. Perhaps it is time for a slight shift, for, defensive measures are also in the interests of Berar, just as offensive measures are."

persian_origins:0 "Persian Origins"
persian_origins_desc:0 "Our nobles and rulers can trace their origins to the region of Persia itself, bringing with them a plethora of knowledge and ideas from outside India. Spreading these ideas and fusing them with Indian ideas on various matters can lead to a rich cultural exchange that Golconda would be foolish to not look into and take advantage of."
patronize_learning_and_buildings:0 "Patronize Learning and Buildings"
patronize_learning_and_buildings_desc:0 "Though our origins lay far away, we have come to adopt the language and customs of the Telugu and surrounding people groups. Combining our knowledge from Persia with the likes of Indian and Muslim engineers to construct elaborate structures that are both prestigious and functional will allow Golconda to flourish in the future in the fields of innovation and grandeur."
golconda_diamonds:0 "Golconda Diamonds"
golconda_diamonds_desc:0 "The rich diamond mine within our territory provides wealth beyond belief, as some would say. Though we carefully cultivate the production of diamonds and gems in our land, we should not be so strict that we inadvertently hinder our income. Reworking and refining our production methods over time will likely ensure that profit margins are firmly in favor of Golconda."
golconda_fort:0 "Golconda Fort"
golconda_fort_desc:0 "The fortress within our capital is not something that should be taken lightly. It is our duty to keep it taken care of and manned whenever necessary so as to keep our capital safe from invaders, but also to help be an example of how to build future fortifications in different areas we come to control."

adopt_deccani_culture_desc:0 "The myriad of peopel groups in the Deccan are briming with opportunity, but also tension, and the administrators of Golconda can see this quite clearly. There must be sustained efforts by our administration to adopt and integrate these different groups of people in the Deccan into Golconda as a whole, thus making Golconda more unified as a whole."

fight_against_the_vijayanagara_empire_desc:0 "To our south is the mighty and fearsome Vijayanagara Empire. Though powerful in many ways, we of Golconda are powerful as well and not willing to let the wrath of the Vijayanagara Empire wash over our land without a fight. To the very last man, Golconda will fight! The Sultanate of Bahmanis may not have been able to do this, but we succeed where they failed at and hold off the threats from the south!"

centralized_deccani_sultanate_desc:0 "As time moves forward, so to do our people. It won't be long before new technologies present new challenges to our authority, which is why we will need more active efforts to centralize power throughout the land into an orderly form. It won't be easy, but it will be worth the effort in the end."

Despite harsh treatment early on in their arrival, the sufis have since increased in number and have brought a sense of wider community to Bijapur as a whole."
capital_of_commerce_and_culture:0 "Commerical and Cultural Hub"
capital_of_commerce_and_culture_desc:0 "Our capital is something of a gem in the central part of India. Being a place of great commerce and culture, our leaders know how to cultivate a thriving hub of merchants and civilians alike as they come from different backgrounds and different regions. Let us continue this great trend and build up our capital to be an economic and cultural heart in India, greater than the cities in the north like Delhi and Lahore!"
palmyra_of_the_deccan:0 "The Palmyra of the Deccan"
palmyra_of_the_deccan_desc:0 "Bijapur, due to our efforts in making sure it is a place for culture and commerce and a place where people from all over India can come and feel as though they are at home, is being nicknamed the 'Palmyra of the Deccan'. The namy 'Palmyra' may be a bit lost on us, but it brings with it apparent prestige and good tidings, so we will gladly adopt it."
southward_ambitions:0 "Southward Ambitions"
southward_ambitions_desc:0 "The south is where our most fearsome competition lies, rather than the north. The Hindu leaders that oppose our might and who would see Bijapur fall into disrepair will know our might and the superiority of our troops; our ambitions will be satiated once we secure the southern realms, and after that, perhaps even other areas."
new_age_of_indian_warfare:0 "New Age of Indian Warfare"
new_age_of_indian_warfare_desc:0 "Gunpowder is continuously making its way into the field of battle at every turn. From two-handed weapons to full on cannons that can breach the walls of stone fortresses, the soldiers of Bijapur are going to need to adapt to this new age of warfare and be the first to use it effectively in India."

develop_the_water_systems_and_hospitals_desc:0 "The water systems of India are often lacking in how clean they are and how refined they could be, as are the hospitals and medical areas around the region. Bijapur has scholars from around its land who are ready to help innovate on both of these fronts if we take them up on their offers, letting the people of Bijapur know both increased health and an increased quality of life."
institute_educational_systems:0 "Institute Educational Systems"
institute_educational_systems_desc:0 "One common controversey that keeps coming up amongst the population of Bijapur is education. More classical ways of education may have been fine in the past for our ancestors, but in a time of increasingly diversifying ways of thought, especially on how education should be conducted and instituted in Bijapuri land, we must be open to new ways of thinking and reforming what we have in place. Bijapur must not be stuck in the past."

the_fall_of_daulatabad_fort_desc:0 "The mighty citadel at Daulatabad stood as a hefty barrier for the Sultanate of Bahmanis, but they have fallen from grace now and have left vast amounts of land and power open for the taking. With our taking of Daulatabad early on, we learned just how important it was to focus on siege tactics and what a prolonged siege requires, making Ahmednagari forces all the better in prolonged wars."
distiniguished_amongst_deccani_sultans:0 "Distinguished in the Deccan"
distiniguished_amongst_deccani_sultans_desc:0 "The Deccan requires strong leadership and dedicated sultans to lead it! The people in the region cannot be left to the hungry powers of Orissa, Gujarat, Malwa, or the Vijayanagara Empire, no, Ahmednagar must prove itself worthy as a righteous Muslim state that can succeed where the Bahmani sultans failed."

blood_on_the_royal_dynasty_desc:0 "Whilst we are sorting out many things in Ahmednagar, from agricultural reforms to tax laws and so much more, we are faced with the fact that our succession to the throne is not always secure and clear. We need to ensure that previous bloody feuds between advisors and family members of our dynasty are sorted out through courts so that a clear heir may be found and put forth for Ahmednagar."
reformation_of_revenue_intake:0 "Ahmednagari Taxation Reform"
reformation_of_revenue_intake_desc:0 "Being focused on warfare and politics for so long makes it so that we lack the ability to focus on other key areas. Other regions such as the Gangetic Plain and the Bengal Delta are working toward land and taxation reforms that Ahmednagar could seriously stand to benefit from. Perhaps we can send envoys to these places to bring back details of these reforms."
ahmednagar_renovations:0 "Frontier Fortifications"
ahmednagar_renovations_desc:0 "We cannot neglect the fortifications scattered around Ahmednagar as time goes on. Sure they may have been good at the time they were built, but we need to be maintainers of these fortifications as well, improving them whenever we can with improved materials or new designs."
persianate_acceptance:0 "Akin to the Persian World"
persianate_acceptance_desc:0 "Much like the cities of Isfahan, Herat, and Tabriz, Ahmednagar (the city) must be a haven not just for those of Persian descent, but rather it must be a haven for all who wish to be part of its growing culture, expansive neighborhoods, and thriving business community. We cannot just turn away Gujarati, Oriya, and Marathi people and deny them access to our great city if we wish to continue to prosper."

These lands are fertile and ready for cultivation over time and our ancestors knew this as well since they were cultivating a powerful and fruitful state as far back as the Spring and Autumn Period.

The specific title 'Duke Yansheng' was created for the direct descendants of Confucius 1055 by the Song Dynasty and from there is has carried forth immense political weight within our home region.

From deities associated with Mount Tai like Bixia Yuanjun and Yanguang Niangniang, to the grandiose places there like Dai Temple and the Shrine of the Blue Dawn, keeping all of these significant places intact and safe from any hostilities will ensure that we are viewed very favorably by other states both inside and outside the Middle Kingdom."

buddhist_and_confucian_pilgrims_here_desc:0 "Though we can keep the sites across our homeland safe, we have yet to ensure that the pilgrims that come to our land are safe too.

northern_shaolin_martial_arts_desc:0 "Though the Shaolin Monastery in Henan province claims to be the origin of Northern Martial Arts, we of the Qi state are so close in proximity that some of that martial prowess has spilled over into our own land with time.

#lessons_of_the_southern_qi_desc:0 "Much like the Northern Qi, the Southern Qi was rife with problems, chief among which were rebellions and corruption at all levels of government.

It was not, however, destined to last as some centuries later, it all came apart in a disastrous civil war, causing the cities to break away one by one. It is our duty to see the cities reunited under the same idea and notion that Ah Mekat Tutul Xiu had; there must be unification amongst the Mayan people, not division."

three_hearts_three_cities_desc:0 "Some call them our three hearts, but in reality they are our three key cities. Cempoala (the place of twenty waters) was the nominal ruler of the Totonacapan Kingdom; Teayo (tortoise atop stone) is the place where we see a mix of various cultures such as Toltax, Mexica, and Huastec; and Tajin is perhaps our greatest city, being inhabited for countless generations (until being burned down in a fire in the 1200's) and being situated along key trade routes along with preserving leftovers from the ancient city of Teotihuacan. With all the successor to Taijin along with the other two cities working together in harmony, we will be able to plan and develop Totonac culture and society further than we've ever thought possible."

The upkeep of them is tough at times, but the effort is well worth it due to the strengthening of our faith through them.

non_human_sacrifices_desc:0 "Contrary to those around us such as the Aztecs, we do not practice human sacrifice... All the time. Our goddess of maize deemed such sacrifices unworthy and not needed, so instead we give herbs, flowers, and animal sacrifices instead. Such people who might normally be used for human sacrifices can instead be put to work in Totonac society instead, developing the land that is uncultivated... And if they disobey, the god of the sun will have them and their hearts."

preserving_totonac_culture_desc:0 "There are several who would see Totonac culture be absorbed into their own and these influences are spreading throughout Totonac society. We must begin to build and keep a unique cultural identity compared to those around us and make our court distinctivly Totonac, rather than perhaps Aztec, Huastec, or Zapotec. It will take some time, but our court will become the bastion and beacon of Totonac culture, long enough for others to sprout up elsewhere."

against_the_aztecs_desc:0 "That triple alliance to the west of us... It threatens our very way of life. Totonac warriors, priests, and commoners alike know the threat the Aztecs are when they are united and this alliance that has formed is nothing short of a ticking threat waiting to exterminate the Totonac people. We need to harden ourselves and prepare our warriors for a fearless campaign against them and any who would support them, and even when the Aztecs are defeated, we must still ready ourselves for what other threats to the Totonacs there may be."

Rebuilding it will be a large undertaking, but completing it will assure us the loyalty and unity of the Totonac people altogether. Let us go forth and trace our steps back to our foundation, and mend the cracks that are there, freeing Totonac society to be whole once again."

The influence from those three cities stretches far and wide, even to the lands of Coixtlahuaca, thus making us in their shadow partially.

Still, it is an important part of Icelandic history and one of the oldest parliaments in the world; using its legacy and perhaps even revitalizing it in the coming years could bring legitimacy and stability to the land once more."

geographic_isolation_and_opportunism_desc:0 "Isolation is something very familiar to Icelanders. But, what our ancestors knew that some people today forget is that Iceland is close to the lands of what is called Greenland, and our old sagas do tell of our ancestors travelling to here and beyond. We can use our isolation in geography, then, as an advantage and begin efforts to expand our domain outward through colonization efforts that are more organized and more effective than the ones our ancestors put forth."

promote_icelandic_fishing_and_trade_desc:0 "Yes, commerce from Iceland is remote and hard to reach, but it is worth the travel for some people, such as those from Ireland, Scotland, Norway, and other northern-oriented nations.

It gets lonely here in Iceland)."

These so called Protestants and Reformed folks are springing up all over Europe and, well, Icelanders are curious as to what will come of themselves now that they too are feeling the effects of the Reformation. Whatever path is chosen for Iceland, the notion of serving the people and promoting stability no matter what will be our primary goal."

One essential part that we have put work into integrating into Gwalior is the effective tax system they left behind, meaning we are able to obtain much higher revenues from the people of our land than other states around us."

Still, Virashimha was not executed and he worked tirelessly to undermine Delhi's efforts to integrate and keep hold of Gwalior, to which he obtained success some years later.

turbulent_past_of_kalahandi_desc:0 "Kalahandi itself has been through a great amount of power shifts between rulers and those who adhere close by to the ruler. The dynamics of these shifts aren't always clear, but the military is always involved in some form. By ensuring that the military is at least curtailed and not capable of seizing all power in Kalahandi, but is actually integrated properly within the state itself, we can organize it in a much better fashion."

rising_power_of_the_nagas_desc:0 "The nagas should never be underestimated. The nagas survived the ancient extermination attempt by Janamejaya, the Kuru king from so long ago, and now they are resurgent today.

It might not be easy to do, but attempting to centralize power and to uphold the authority of Kalahandi over chiefs and local leaders may do us more good than we currently anticipate."

garjati_fortress_control_desc:0 "The lands of the Garjati people are filled with scattered fortifications that are often under the control of semi-independent tribal chiefs.

garjati_adaptive_warfare:0 "Adaptive Warfare"
garjati_adaptive_warfare_desc:0 "The tropical climate of the Garjati homes are not home to the most stable fighting grounds. Often there are uneven hills, sudden ridges, dense jungles, and uncultivated areas that make warfare much more small-scale and scattered. By adapting our strategy to not only this terrain, but whatever terrain we find ourselves on, we can make the fight for enemies even worse and the fight for us even more advantageous."

This act has mostly been seen occurring during the various Muslim invasions of the subcontinent and there have been prominent cases of jauhar happening in Jaisalmer's history.

If one can mint their own coins from gold, one exercises a plethora of influence over areas where those minted coins go, but this has rarely been the case ever since the Banu Marin began to wane in power. Perhaps through minting coinage in the image and likeness of our own rulers, we will be able to overcome the Banu Marin."

The precision by which its walls were made, the dams inside were structured, and how the living quarters were planned out tells us exactly how the Almoravids wanted this place to be garrisoned for the future. In time, our efforts to emulate the defensive design of Jebel Mudawwar will make it even harder for enemies to occupy any stretch of our land."

We have taken lessons from the Almoravids, the Almohads, and the Banu Marin on how to effectively administrate various pieces of land, but we have not been able to truly exercise independet rulership in a long while.

to_meld_amazigh_arab_and_andalusians_together_desc:0 "Being that Fez is strategically located in the northern part of Morocco, it has seen a great deal of migrants and settlers ever since its founding years under Idris I and his son, Idris II. Some Amazigh groups settled down in Fez, Arab clans moved in at times, and even Andalusian immigrants were encouraged to settle down in Fez during the times of the al-Andalus. Such a plethora of descendants intermixing inside Fez has made it so that information and knowledge spread very easily throughout its varied communities."

the_old_struggle_for_dominance_over_fez_desc:0 "Fez has not always been a bastion of peace, however, as the the falling of the Idrisid Dynasty of Morocco led to ambitious leaders of the Umayyad Caliphate in al-Andalus and the Fatimid Caliphate in the east to push their own agendas in the region. They struggled to keep Fez because they knew it held great political significance in the region, and it is that significance that we still hold to this day thanks to the patronage of the Banu Marin."

islamic_studies_throughout_fez_rekindled_desc:0 "Ever since the Almoravids patronized the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, Fez has slowly become a center of Islamic scholarship that many look up to. Whilst the Almohad Caliphate halted such scholarly measures for traditional Islam, the rise of the Banu Marin helped revive Islamic scholarly studies in Fez. Whatever happens to the Banu Marin matters not, what matters now is that we continue the religious dialogue and strengthen the traditional institutions of Islam in Fez itself."

making_kasbah_bou_jeloud_and_example_to_follow_desc:0 "When the ALmoravids took over Fez, they built the kasbah named Bou Jeloud toward the western part of the city. The Almohad Caliphate destroyed it during their siege then rebuilt the kasbah with more ambitious plans. Finally, the Banu Marin expanded the kasbah further, cementing it as not only a military complex, but also as courtly one where political authority can be maintained from. Thus, the example of Bou Jeloud should be what we strive for when constructing new fortifications: military functionality at its center, but grand enough to serve ceremonial purposes."

The ambitions of our rulers are present, the fortifications are ready for any invaders, but is the court of Fez competent enough to live up to the task of governing a rebuilt Morocco? Such questions must be put to rest through the recruitment of genuine scholars that find a Fassi authority to be the most productive and efficient."

Without it, we would be set adrift in a sea of religious chaos and political turmoil, easy pickings for our hungry neighbors.

Most warfare is decided out at sea, however, since most of the profitable trade that people fight over flows via oceanic trade routes, so we'd be wise to ensure that our sailors and admirals are well versed in naval warfare both at range and up close."

Their legacy is what we must cultivate as we continue on in the very same place as they were once at."

ifat_sultanate_ties_desc:0 "Before our time, there was the Ifat Sultanate that rose to prominence in the east and expanded westward toward Shewa. Often times they would clash with the likes of Christians and this would bring about great battles the likes of which previous states had not seen.

tensions_with_the_oromo_desc:0 "The Oromo are more than a small issue, they are a contentious ethnic group that often seek to migrate and settle in places that are already inhabited by others, especially Amhara people akin to our own. We need a system of some kind to distinguish between the Oromo and Amhara, a line of separation so that we can root out troubled parts of our state that are most likely Oromo in nature. They've caused issues for us and other Amhara states in the past, we will learn from their failures in this area."

Siding with one side or the other will invoke the ire of another side and possible revolts throughout the land or it could invoke retribution from outside the state.

Though it was distant from strong central authority due to its location, it did help maintain authority in the area and it helped build up fortifications and a military presence in the region. Why disregard the methods for maintain and develop the land of such a place like Karelia if they come from a power that formally held authority over us?

During the time of the Samanids, Bukhara's people may have still worshipped idols at times along with others following Islam, but their work at building Bukhara up made it into an intellectual center of the Islamic world.

Therefore we must not stay stagnant in our ways of the past with largely cavalry-based armies that use shock tactics primarily. We should be looking to modernize and adapt our weapons so that we can compete with other states around us, but also we must recognize that our traditional fighting style still does offer advantages in certain situations.

Its custody, protection, and ownership remains a large subject in several circles in our own nation as it gives us both prestige and reputation amongst other Islamic nations. On top of this, the firm control over the two sites gives us a degree of religious authority, attracting a number of Islamic scholars and imams of which some wish to spread the message of Islam to other lands.

Islamic conquest carried out by them is not lost on us and we are set on reviving it. Already there are soldiers of ours who deem in an honor to conquer in the name of Islam, yet restraint must be maintained with even the most zealous of soldiers in our service.

The system of succession must be refined and the court of ours must have strict order within it so that we do not fall prey to the various court schemes that plagued the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphate. Once succession rites are secured and our court is in line, nothing will stand in the way of our expansion in the name of Islam."

Though spreading the word of the prophet is certainly needed, we must not forget these trade connections in the slightest. The revenue they can bring for us if utilized well enough is not insignificant and by connectiing with the scattered trade-based Islamic communities that have sprouted up throughout the centuries, we will be able to extract greater amounts of revenue yet."

We must communicate clearly with them, establish good relations with the tribes and clans, and ensure that they are loyal to the higher authorities of the land.

Now though, through our hard work and astute leadership, we have become the catalayst and the holders of a new golden era of the Arabian Peninsula that sees not division and destruction, but rather cooperation and prosperity.

There are small sects of Shiite Muslims (such as Hurufis and Hafizis), Sunni Muslims (such as the Maturidis and Mu'tazilites), and Ibadi Muslims that would seek to chip away at Arabia's religious harmony so that they can promote a more pure version of Arabia in their eyes, but this destructive revolution cannot be allowed to take place.

Indeed the harshest parts of our land are deserts that test the survival skills of any person no matter their creed or culture, which is exactly why our soldiers train in such harsh environments. Growing accustom to the arid terrain over months and years trains both the bodies and minds of our soldiers whilst also giving commanding experience to our military leaders. Remember, if they can't handle logistics or giving out orders when out in the middle of the Arabian Peninsula, they aren't fit for service!"

To work on healing these divides between Sunnis, Shiites, Ibadis, and even small sects of the Kharwarij, we must promote a peaceful atmosphere of religious conversation amongst our mosques and madrasas."

The more rural parts of Arabia can certainly be havens for brigands and bandits but it is not impossible to reinforce set paths through both sand and dirt various tombs, mosques, or holy cities.

Whilst the sharif of Mecca was reluctant to get involved in politics in previous generations, the unification of Arabia has brought the sharif into a new light of political prominence and influence across Islam as a whole. Actions by our government that get special approval by the sharif are thus seen as far more legitimate than if they were done without them chiming in at all."

safeguarded_merchants_and_fleets_desc:0 "If there is one thing that hurts confidence in merchants and the wider trade network as a whole, it is when deals fall through for one reason or another. Perhaps the ships sink in a storm or they got robbed by brigands or privateers, it still all leads to people less willing to partake in trade and thus lowering economic gains for all normally involved. Arabia can remedy these downsides by reinforcing trade ships with sturdier materials and better navigational charts so that there is less of a chance that we lose money in oceanic trade."

forward_with_islamic_innovations_desc:0 "In the past, Islamic communities held a prestigious place in the world of philosophy and natural science since classical work from ages in the past were translated and communicated in places across the caliphates of old. We must strive to bring back this sense of scientific insight and innovative thinking even if it is with an Islamic lens. The future for Arabia is not always in remembering the past, but rather it is in combining past traditions with forward thinking and inquisitive minds."

Truly our people will forget their past if these monuments of old are just left to disappear before our very eyes! We can take action before it is too late, however. Arabian engineers and scholars specialized in preservation and natural science can help us preserve our monumental history and perhaps even remake them into resurrected, functional structures."

Famines still occur, however, due to the lack of proper distribution of food from regions like Egypt and Mesopotamia, which is exactly why we are going to work on how we distribute food in every single town and city. The more food people have availablet to alleviate hardships, the more keen they will be to serve Arabia as a whole."

Slave soldiers are no strange thing in the Islamic world as it is since the practice was widely used even during the time of the Abbasid Caliphate, yet even with Arabia using slave soldiers to a lesser extent compared to Salah al-Din or al-Mustansir, their legacy lives on through us.

Within Damascus and indeed within the wider scope of the Levant as a region, the Umayyad Caliphate found a great deal of power, influence, and prestige the likes of which the Rashidun Caliphate was on its way toward until the First Fitna broke out.

Languages and cultures we have only read about in various texts are slowly becoming more and more common in Arabian cities across the Levant and nearby regions thanks to these more global connections, meaning that our tolerance and eventual acceptance of these foreign customs should gradually increase with time."

Whilst we are not going to spread these false beliefs across our land, we can at least learn from them through theological debates and religious studies.

Scientific patronage was emphasized as was the translation of texts from older languages into Arabic, all whilst maintaining the authority of the seated caliph throughout the ever expanding Islamic world. Though the Abbasids are no longer around in terms of temporal and religious authority, we can still channel their legacy through strengthening our patronage of new technologies and innovative thinkers from Mosul to Basra."

Though we can try to pray to Allah for help against these diseases, we must learn from past outbreaks and try new methods at stopping the spread of these terrible plagues. Isolation, new medicinal remedies, and attempting to learn from those who have suffered and lived helps contribute to our understanding of how to fight off these foul ailments."

Though the times are very much different now and cities like Tabriz are taking over, we can very much still build our home city into something as great or even greater than what it once was.

mongol_remnants_desc:0 "The remnants of the once great Mongol Empire lay around us, scattered and fighting each other for dominance over various areas and regions that were once conquered in the 13th century. We must rise above the rest of the crowd of hordes and states that have risen up from the ashes and prove that the Khalkha are the true heirs to the once great empire."
#relation_to_the_jalayirs:0 "Relations to the Jalayirs"
#relation_to_the_jalayirs_desc:0 "Though quite distant in their prominence as they converted to Islam and attempted to found their own state in the west, the Jalayirs are still related at the very core to us Khalkhas. We can use our connections with them to help mediate disputes when we conquer new land, especially in lands that harbor Islamic communities toward the western parts of the old Mongol Empire."
relation_to_the_jalayirs:0 "Jalairs Across the Steppe"
relation_to_the_jalayirs_desc:0 "The sands of time have been relatively kind to the Jalairs despite the collapse of various steppe hordes around them. Their influence stretches from the lands of the Mongols to the lands of the Iranian people, meaning that if we can entice more Jalairs to pledge fealty to us even if they are in foreign domains, we will have a much easier time annexing new territory."
buddhist_haven_of_the_north:0 "Buddhist Haven of the North"
buddhist_haven_of_the_north_desc:0 "The Khalkha are staunchly Buddhist in their faith and traditions and they are not set on changing from this, despite what Islamic traditions come from the west and what Confucian principles may come from the south. However, we of the Khalkha must recognize that the other faiths are not inherently destructive to the Khalkha way of life or way of governance. If we can fully realize this and make efforts to promote religious harmony whilst also preserving our Buddhist roots, we'll be able to maintain firm control over own land."
oirat_and_zungar_tensions:0 "Oirat and Zunghar Tensions"
oirat_and_zungar_tensions_desc:0 "The Oirat and Zunghar are not simple enemies that have popped up, they are rivals of us and seek hegemony of these great lands just like we do. Throughout ruthless diplomacy and strategic warfare, we must subdue these other two groups of Mongols and project the unity brought forth by the early years of the Mongol Empire."
learning_diplomatic_matters:0 "Learning Diplomatic Matters"
learning_diplomatic_matters_desc:0 "Diplomacy has never been a great field for Mongol people in the past; at best we were standard at it, but others around us excelled in the diplomatic realm and got advantages over us in the past. By practicing our diplomatic approach inside our own land between tribes and between different administrative branches, we can prepare ourselves for conducting astute and careful diplomacy with foreigners."
unite_the_disparate_mongol_tribes:0 "Unite the Mongol Tribes"
unite_the_disparate_mongol_tribes_desc:0 "The basis for the ambition to unite the entirety of the Mongol tribes is within a great many people, but to fully realize this ambition into something whole, one must learn more. The Khalkha are ready for this next step of cultural understanding and cooperation as the many different groups that inhabit the lands north of the Middle Kingdom will need to be accepted and integrated rather than excluded and persecuted."
organization_of_the_khalkhas:0 "Organizing the Khalkhas"
organization_of_the_khalkhas_desc:0 "The system of old tribes and clans has done us well for a long time, but the Khalkhas are changing like many other people around us. They are learning, adapting, and changing in their culture on the largest scale we administrate from all the way down to the individual Khalkha person. We need not halt this change over time, rather, we need to learn how to organize ourselves within these changes and manage how they are implemented throughout our society. If we can do so, not even time itself will pose a threat to the Khalkha people."

Being outside of the Middle Kingdom and in the vast steppe region, our history is undoubtedly intertwined with the legends of before, such as the Four Oirats, the Northern Yuan, the Uzbeks, the Kazakhs, and many other groups. Zungharia is but a small part of this entire place, but it is our homeland and as any homeland should, it deserves to be united through any means possible."

rivalry_against_the_khalkhas_desc:0 "They have been our rivals for a great many years now and it does not seem like we are going to find peace anytime soon. Whoever shows the most martial prowess and the greatest leadership skills in the steppe is the one that comes out on top and we of Zungharia will show this through the fires of war. The Khalkhas will submit to the true authority of the steppe that are the leaders of Zungharia."

cut_down_pretenders_desc:0 "Our power may seem secure to those outside of our realm, but on the inside, we know there are people who plot the downfall of the Zunghar people and their state. Whether in the form of palace coups or open separatist revolts, we must actively work to gather information on these groups of rebels and cut them down before they can prove to be deadly to us."

influences_in_tibet_desc:0 "Long have the hordes of the steppe had interests in the lands of Tibet as the Dalai Lama, the foremost spiritual leader for our branch of Buddhism, hails from and is usually found inside Tibetan land. By extending our influence beyond our nominal borders and using our connections through faith, we can promote not only a greater spiritual unity amongst the Zunghar people, but also a greater legitimate authority over the entirety of the steppe."

buying_new_weaponry_desc:0 "From the west and the south, new weapons are coming in that are far more effective than our traditional bow-and-arrow, even on horseback.

take_the_throne_of_the_steppe_desc:0 "The steppe is a harsh place full of warring states and different people groups, but there was a time of unity throughout that we look back upon fondly. Yes, the Mongol Empire is no more, but that does not mean another state cannot claim the throne they left vacant! The Zunghars will be the next in line to claim this throne and will be the ones to bring unity to the steppe once more, just as they already have to Zungharia."

settle_and_conquer_desc:0 "The land we now claim as our own is sparsely populated which is perfect for us to thrive in. Without much internal unrest at our core, we can focus on planting our foundations down, ensuring a strong and stable system of governance that does not disrespect our ancestral roots, and then going forth and expanding outward. Perhaps in time we can conquer back east and greet our old family members."

This position we are in is more of a diplomatic opportunity for us and for the ones around us, and if we play our cards right with either the Orthodox Russians or the Sunni Turks, we can secure our independent status in the region."

Though the wider goal of this document's goal of ulimate unification of our people, the Oirats, may not be possible, we can at least adhere to the parts of it that regulate and uphold the nomadic ways of life we have had since our inception."

surrounding_military_influences_desc:0 "The Russian military and the Turkish military are influential on us, just like how we as a political entity are influential on them. Though we are used to more cavalry-based tactics that have served us well in the Steppe for decades upon decades, the new weapons and strategies brought to light by the Russians and Turks should be examined thoroughly and in time, integrated into our own military."
experience_in_rough_terrain:0 "Rough Terrain Combat"
experience_in_rough_terrain_desc:0 "The land we fight in (whether it be for ourselves or because of mercenary contracts) is often harsh and brutal. Mountains, deserts, arid and infertile land, all are places where the Kalmyks have fought in for various reasons and it is through these experiences that they become enduring soldiers that can withstand these harsh conditions."

maintain_kalmyk_authority_desc:0 "If there is one thing that was evident in our lands, it was political disunity. Even today this trait runs through the Kalmyks since in the past we have faced times where different groups of people proclaim a different khan than the actual one in line for the throne. We must work to resolve these political struggles as they go on and then work to make sure they are few and far between in the future. The life of the Kalmyk state depends on whether or not we can manage to do this successfully."

mongol_subjects_desc:0 "Traditionally the Mongols to our south came north to us, the Buryats, and demanded formal subject status from us along with regular gifts of tribute. Seeing that arrangements were well and good, and because we were not in any position to really resist, we agreed and became subjects for generations on end. Now though, the Mongols are broken and shattered, scavenging for resources and leadership whilst the Buryats roam free again. We must not hasten to do away with everything the Mongols taught us in our past as their military leadership and organization is something that we should always keep with us through the future."

ties_to_the_oirat_desc:0 "The Oirats have been a friend to the Buryats for many years and have helped us in resisting some of the influences from the eastern Mongols after the once great empire of the 1200s fell into pieces. These good relations will be beneficial to us in the future when we need fresh support against incoming threats; they may not be our family, but they can fight by our side like family members would."

kinship_of_the_buryats_desc:0 "Kinship and marriage are vital parts of our society. Spiritually and socially, we are bound up in the ties of kinship that outsiders may find strange, but these ties have been around for several decades now and help stabilize our people into thriving communities that can survive in the harsh climate of the north."

religion_of_the_buryats_desc:0 "Nature is where our spiritual focus lies. It has been passed down to us for generations now with varying influences from the southern religions of Buddhism and Tengrism, but the notion of our people and our own religion has not gone away despite there being no holy text or scripture to follow. We should not, however, be closed off to the old religious influences, for they too can relate to our own and may hold wisdom for the Buryats themselves."
migration_and_semi_nomadic_life:0 "Semi-Nomadic Life"
migration_and_semi_nomadic_life_desc:0 "The harsh lands we live in does not lend itself easily to a settled life full of agriculture. The tundre and cold weather often make life difficult for settled folks to thrive in, thus encouraging more of a semi-nomadic way of life, which the Buryats have had for centuries now. With this in mind, we have not and will not have any issue moving supplies, troops, or people around when the time comes."

siberian_forest_combat_desc:0 "The dense forests of our land make for good defensive measures whenever we should need them.

enduring_buryats_desc:0 "Despite the subjugation of before, the Buryat people endured and survived to see the other side of things. This should be a clear sign that we can triumph through the lowest of lows and hardest of times with a clear mind and a heart set in the way of ancestral guidance and wisdom. No matter what happens to us, we must see things through to the end."

The heritage of conquest that was brought about by Ghenghis Khan runs through all Mongol remnants that rose up out of the ashes of the Golden Horde, the Ilkhanate, the Chagatai Khanate, and the Yuan Dynasty. We, the Chahars, are no different in this sense."

The Chahars in relation to have been used as part of tumens before and to this day have a strong memory of this, meaning that they can be recruited, armed, and prepared for combat much faster than other people or states. The Chahar people should never and will never be caught off guard and without a means to fight back."

We would be foolish not to learn from our mistakes and from how our enemies seem to prosper whilst we are suffering."

northern_yuan_assistance_desc:0 "With the shattered nature of the core Mongol region, the various dynasties and khans are actively trying to rally support for their own cause and their own state. The Chahars are no different in this sense and the volatile atmosphere has made for great mercenary deals to be made; we are going to need all the military manpower we can get if we seek to carve out a living in amongst the fierce descendants of the Mongol Empire."
crossroads_of_mongols_and_chinese:0 "Crossroads of Cultures"
crossroads_of_mongols_and_chinese_desc:0 "Our core location is near enough to the Chinese that we encounter them quite often on an individual basis. Though there is a distinct different between Chinese culture and Mongol culture, the Chahars serve as a bridge between these two cultures and allow for a more flexible diplomatic position overall. Precarious positions sometimes offer benefits not initially seen."

#south_east_asian_thalassocracy_desc:0 "The maritime nature of areas south of the lands of the Cham, Thai, and Mon people makes having a strong and capable navy necessary. Dominating trade routes and open waters around the various islands is key to Malaya being a true trade hegemon; securing our waters will in turn help us secure our inland areas on Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the Malay Peninsula."

In order to deal with these three powerful forces embedded within the various people in our nation, we must be tolerant and accepting of these different faiths as opposed to trying to persecute each and every person who does not follow our chosen faith."

As Malaya continues to grow internally, building up infrastructure in various towns and promoting the growth of various urban centers, the trade opportunities found on the various islands will only increase as time goes on.

Just as the navy was integral to the conquest of various lands, our navy will be needed so that we can expand our own borders. As trade is the life-blood of Malaya, we must not let our rivals drain this away from us by holding valued centers of trade and important harbors; thus, we must conquer, annex, and integrate for the greater good that is the nation of Malaya."

There must be no other competitor and no other rival force in or near our homeland so that there can be one producer of all the valued spice. It's no more simple than this: The spice must flow."

To be part of our great state is to be at home next to and on the water itself, and those who take this innate trait to heart and make it their calling in life go on to become esteemed sailors in our navy.

From huge gusts of wind to torrential bouts of rain and sometimes even ruthless volcanic eruptions, surviving in some parts of our state is a true test of grit, skill, and state resources. In order to try to mitigate future expenses for when nature rises up against us, we should look into building better houses not just for peasants, but for every single community we can."

From Chams sailing around to do business with Malays or Bantenese people taking part in ceremonies alongside Banjarese people, we can list so many ways we witness these interactions go forth in peaceful, productive ways. If we can help foster these good interactions more often and perhaps even create and official system of circulated, official languages throughout the islands, we might be able to sow more fealty and reap more rewards."

The eyes and ears of our state must be ready for whatever comes forth from our subjects and we must not seek to incite our own subjects to turn against or stray away; thus, a much more robust and multi-lingual diplomatic organization will be needed going forward."

What we can do going forward is plan a much more universal design that is worked on by some of the finest traders in the entire realm. Having 2 or 3 designs to work with for each and every dock is much easier than 4 or more to choose from, and it will help ensure the navy can put what it needs on each trade ship as well (merhcants need protection too)."

Whether it is for flavoring food right away or helping preserve food for later or perhaps even making new substances for alchemical or healing purposes, our islands have been home to these coveted plants for countless years.

Whether it has been because of injustice done by local governors or feuds between families spiraling out control or some other conflict, these islands we call home can still be havens of strife if we allow them to be. By instilling a more cohesive and efficient system of administration on each and every major island we control, we can manage these local conflicts in earnest."

Upholding the notions of peaceful religious dialogue and punishing those who would incite religious violence is what we should strive for no matter who the people are; muftis and monks alike cannot be exempt from the law of the land if we are to see peace across all people groups."

In order to better remedy this and ensure that our own stocks are always filled, we should be looking to cultivate more of the tropical inland areas we already control so that plantations, mills, and farming estates can established in a more orderly fashion. The more reserves of various goods we have, the safer we will be later on."

From the days of Majapahit to the rise of Malacca, picking up the fragmented pieces of power scattered across places like Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and the Malay Peninsula has been nothing short of impossible to do. That was the case before our rise to power, at least, for now we have come to encompass all the fertile islands of our home region and more, thus succeeding where our ancestors left off."

soldiers_paid_in_full_desc:0 "Whereas the previous eras saw levies and local militas be the norm for most states across the likes of Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and Borneo, Majapahit cultivated a different form of military service in their vast realm: paid, professional soldiers. Should we be able to garner enough financial stability like Majapahit had in the past, we too can pay soldiers a regular salary and employ them for years instead of relying on good will or forcing them to serve through fear and intimidation. It would be through these years of service that sustained discipline in our ranks would be maintained."

blood_of_past_empires_in_us_desc:0 "Previously, the states that were Srivijaya and Majapahit held sway over a huge part of the islands we call home. Though they are long gone and we have come to replace their once mighty empires, the foundations they laid out for us in terms of governing practices and routes of expansion are still useful to us. To be a true succesor to both would be to unify each and every island around us into one state, something we are already keen on doing before we start expeditions to other lands to our north and to our south."

reprisals_in_headhunting_and_brutality_desc:0 "There are several practices that have shaped our identity as an up-and-coming state in the world, but perhaps one of the most defining facets of a subset of our people is headhunting. Whilst we have been able to stop outright headhunting in civil areas and advocate against using it for civil and personal issues, our soldiers and sailors are allowed to continue the practice in full when out on the field of battle. Brutality in this manner helps instill an atmosphere of fear in our enemies, both internal political enemies and external states that would see us conquered."

Whether they move for economic reasons, political interests, religious matters, or for familial issues, we should attempt to keep a record of these movements of people across our land so that we can effectively calculate how to tax people, track where more infrastructure might be needed, predict where merchants may be moving to, or possibly predict when a disaster will strike."

mutual_meeting_grounds_of_trade_desc:0 "If there is one thing that our records indicate, both archived records and new ones that are being made each and every day, it is that mercantile matters brings together people from every walk of life. It doesn't matter if it is an Iranian merchant that espouses Islam or a Vaishnavite farmer that is looking to spend his money, they along with many others can and do form mutually beneficial trading relationships throughout our land. We would be fools to let religion divide up our merchants and markets; we can tolerate what they preach, just so long as they are willing to do business with us!"
power_from_the_bottom_on_up:0 "Power to the People"
power_from_the_bottom_on_up_desc:0 "From our humble beginnings, it was instilled in us that authority can't be wielded by one single ruler alone in their court. To rule a piece of land, or in our case, to rule a variety of islands with huge amounts of diversity in religion and culture, a ruler must realize that ultimate authority is a balancing act that must be organized from the bottom up instead of strictly from the top down. Once every member of our administration realizes and follows this way of thinking, we can work toward a much more flexible governing structure that keeps the needs of the people and state in mind."

autonomy_begets_good_governance_desc:0 "It does not matter where you go in our realm, you will find political issues in every single community that might turn deadly or might be resolved on good terms. It is our job to ensure that we do not try to be overly zealous with our legislation in our communities since there are several local customs and traditions that might not exactly follow what our laws stipulate. Where we can compromise with locals, we will, but we must not attempt to bend each and every single one to our will, lest we want unrest to boil over due to people resisting what might be seen as us erasing their culture."

professional_and_unprofessional_navy_desc:0 "Foreign navies use different standards compared to us, but why should we ever need to abide by their guidelines on naval warfare? Seizing enemy ships and sailors as well as cultivating a ruthless but efficient navy has been part of our history for ages at this point and we are not going to change our ways in the near future. In fact, if we can use enemy ships to replace our own wrecked or aging ships, that'll cut down on future costs!"

Whether it's civilians succumbing to wild life, soldiers dying of disease, or merchants suffering from storms, we must work toward ensuring that the movement of every person is unhindered no matter where they are. Whether they are well built roads or merely clean cut trails through the jungle, every major community needs clear avenues of travel."

outer_island_networking_desc:0 "Further to the north and west of our state are places where urban growth and state building have become normalized, whereas to our east and south, there are very few tribes or communities that can be called a true state like ours. Despite these less advanced people being on our border, we have traded with them for generations and still hold them as key allies. Slowly integrating them into our expanding realm will allow us to utilize their natural harbors and coastal areas for our growing naval force and mercantile matters."

formal_gunpowder_military_matters_desc:0 "Gunpowder weapons are not as easy to use in our part of the world due to tropical weather, but still they are undoubtedly vital for any thriving state today. The plentiful natural resources on all of the islands we encompass can be used to further bolster our production of gunpowder weapons, we just need to actually get the resources to our workshops and manufacturing areas so that refinement can take place. Soon enough we will have muskets and cannons for every single soldier in our realm!"
merchant_diplomats:0 "Merchant Diplomats"
merchant_diplomats_desc:0 "There is some risk in having our diplomats double up as merchants, but we know that good business deals go hand-in-hand with good diplomatic treaties most of the time. As it is, we rely heavily on merchants to bring in a hefty amount of money for us, money that taxation of our population alone would not be able to provide, so combining our diplomatic efforts with our mercantile efforts will help our state become more capable on the world stage as new markets open up to us; new markets that are also home to new states to make deals with."

How others deal with the Oromo is not for us to think about, we simply need to ensure that we can beat them out in a head-to-head conflict. How does one do that? By having a strong-willed and disciplined military that can overcome whatever tactics are employed by the Oromo. To ensure the integrity of the Welayta state, we must be able to fight."

With these changes, we are experiencing societal tension the likes of which aren't used to but that must be dealt with.

janjiros_isolation_desc:0 "Traditionally we have been isolated from several other kingdoms and states due to our location. The mountains and rivers make for nearly impassable terrain entrances into Janjiro land and it is because of this isolation that we can administrate the land much better than other places.

integrate_firearms_desc:0 "The usage of firearms was only just being introduced to the Adal Sultanate when it fell which means we can pick up where they left off at.

As such, this land can easily be conquered on paper, that is. Actually doing so is another matter entirely and we will need extensive measures in the Qasimi administration to afford these conquered lands. With the partially Russified and flexible administration we have, it should not be that large of an endeavor."

Though the lands may be that of a buffer state in the eyes of neighboring powers, these are the lands by which the Qasimi call home and will defend to the very end.

This has to change with future times, however, as we can't continue to allow the tribes to roam and cause havoc on trade and internal connections throughout Tripoli.

against_the_sultans_desc:0 "Previous rulers of ours have tried to assert control over the Gulf of Khambhat, but the sultans that reign from Ahmedabad have turned our people back every single time. That does not deter us, however, and our ambitions still lie in the destruction of the power those fiendish sultans have and uniting our home region under one authority. If this takes years or decades to happen, then so be it."

pirates_of_gujarat_desc:0 "In order to weaken the power of the Gujarat sultans, our previous leaders attempted to perform piracy against them in and around the Gulf of Khambhat. Though some see piracy as a petty measure that won't get very far, we are convinced that it can and will help force other nations around us into submission or at the very least to the negotiating table."

descendant_states_desc:0 "Many members of the Gohil Dynasty have branched off and created small states within our land, uniting more rural communities under themselves and acting as a sort of administrative division for us as a whole. Uniting them under a firm top-down administration that can work effectively and coherently will allow us to draw on the power they have stored up."

controlling_saurashtra_desc:0 "The nature of Saurashtra has been divided for a great many years. Few if any have ever united for long and even when they did, it was still rife with communal or tribal feuds that often hindered the productivity of the land itself. Control, then, must not come from outside the region, but rather from inside the region itself, and who better than those of Palitana? Under our guidance, we can ensure a righteous and profitable future for the strategically situated cities through the region."

Ensuring that monetary practices are flowing smoothly, that trade is without hinderance, and that our production methods are being consistently refined will help attract foreign investors and traders. If we can round everything out, Palitana will be set for a grand future."

To this day we are still dealing with intermittent fallout from this breaking away and it has given way to a variety of tensions between Muslim and Hindu communities, but we must not capitulate to these minor factors. Cirebon must overcome these challenges and secure itself against powers who want to exploit this tension."

Key to our foundation as it is, we shall not stop in our efforts to spread Islam into the various places that Cirebon takes interest in. Whether it is by soldiers of our state or merchants from our coasts, Islam must flow outward from the bastion that is Cirebon."

We of Demak know this better than other small states on Java since we are partially connected to Majapahit, even in its dying breaths. We must not let their legacy go to waste and we must not let the opportunity to consolidate Javanese land pass us by."

successor_to_majapahit_desc:0 "The once great empire towered over the lands of Nusantara. Stretching from Java to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra and even parts of Borneo, it has truly left an impression upon all states that succeeded it. Demak must follow the path that Majapahit did in some capacity so that it may grow to become the hegemon of the islands; conquest is the main measure by which we can fulfill Majapahit's legacy for now."

consolidate_control_over_the_coasts_desc:0 "The lucrative coastal settlements along Java are home to a wide variety of merchants from the west, but they are still lacking in a central authority to answer to.

Javanese sailors and ships can and will be the envy of the world!"

contesting_spice_trade_control_desc:0 "The spice trade is lucrative to all in Nusantara and all still strive to claim it entirely, but few have the capability to make their ambition a reality.

thalassocracy_from_java:0 "Thalassocracy from Java"
thalassocracy_from_java_desc:0 "Keeping control of the spice trade means keeping naval control of the trade routes that go into and out of Nusantara.

Let none stand in our way when it comes to keeping the waters safe and lucrative."

learning_inland_fighting_desc:0 "The lands of Java are harsh for making military movements and sieges. They require hefty planning and can often take a larger toll on the military than one might expect.

Petty local lords and authorities often seek to gain power in one way or another that is not always the most honest or proper, causing tension amongst various people in our administration. To counter this, we need to be appointing people of our own choosing more often, people who we know can do a good job and who are also loyal to Banten as a whole."

protectionism_in_force_desc:0 "Like other states in our region have done in the past, we must now turn to the waters to secure our trade. Ship-to-ship warfare is going to only increase as time goes on and the navy of Banten must be ready for whatever hostile fleet comes into its own waters.

Our land was seen as a vassal of sorts to the core of Majapahit and it developed steadily alongside the heart of the once great empire.

It shows just how influential and powerful the area of Blambangan had become, and though we lost back then to the Majapahit Empire, the memory of this period in history brings a sense of legitimacy to the administration of Blambangan today."

lonely_hindu_kingdom_desc:0 "With the loss of Majapahit and the decline of the Sunda Kingdom, Blambangan is one of the only Hindu states left on Java. In our lonesome state, we face threats from all directions since they would see the last vestige of the Majapahit Empire taken over and executed out of existence.

expel_muslim_insurgents_desc:0 "With the rise of Islam in the west on Sumatra and in the Malay Peninsula, Java seems to be the only bastion of Hinduism left in the main chain of islands. The states to our west are seeking to convert our people and snuff out the lasting legacy of Hinduism in Blambangan, but we shall not let them! We must ensure that our administration is strictly Hindu in most if not all aspects. If this means empowering the Brahmins to help us in this effort, then it is a price we must pay."
centralize_trading_authority:0 "Centralizing Trade"
centralize_trading_authority_desc:0 "Trade in Java has routinely been decentralized thanks to the internal nature of the island itself.

Bali will undoubtedly benefit from this influence as it continues to strive for greatness."

royal_libraries_for_manuscripts_desc:0 "Along with courtly culture, Majapahit officials and scholars brought with them various manuscripts that were revered by many. To safely store them, there should be a royal library (more than one, possibly) built so that our ruler and the administrative cadre can read upon the past in a whole and complete manner. In time, as new works are written in the coming years, they will be stored in our royal libraries."

Bali has become a new refuge and home for Javanese culture as a result of this slow migration and it is through this recognition of our rising status that we will bring back the grand days of the past, before Islam made its way into our lands."

This can and will lead to increased strife within Aceh since these people will become so numerous that they will eventually want to revolt.

Along with this, griots are important for telling the ancestral tales and history of Jolof, so they occupt a social class all unto themselves.

Coastal areas are becoming more wealthy than inland areas due to the rise in international trade and this is having a troubling effect on Jolof itself. To remedy this, we must setup roads and communication networks of some form so that Jolof is less landlocked and more easily able to access the coast from its tributary states. If all goes well, trade potential and wealth distribution will equal out over time."

Over the decades though, it has evolved into a center of culture and military might that must be defended at any cost. Since Kaabu's inception, we have relied more on offense over defense, but seeing as Kansala is becoming more and more central to our administration and military, and our trade depots are increasingly valued by a number of different groups, we need to properly fortify what we currently hold with walls and garrisons."

arboreas_ambition_come_to_life_desc:0 "Though the grave for the Judicate of Arborea is already upon the land, their legacy lives on through us and all of the Sardinian people. Uniting them into one cohesive state and ousting all others from the lands of Sardinia is something that the Judicare of Arborea wasn't able to do, but it was something they so desperately wanted. That is what we shall seek out and once it is accomplished, we will not stop there for the glory and greatness of Sardinia."

migrants_from_mali_desc:0 "Our foundations are somewhat murky and unclear, but what foundation we can know firmly is that many of our people hail from the old Mali Empire. Though not as powerful as it once was and crumbling to outside influence and internal decay, those migrants from Mali have made their home in the lands of Kong and helped it prosper ever since."
coming_from_different_war_houses:0 "From Different War Houses"
coming_from_different_war_houses_desc:0 "The founding people of Kong were not from one single dynasty or one single clan or war house, but rather they were from several different war houses. Their names have changed over the decades but what remains the same throughout time is the contribution to the military potential within Kong itself. Their fearsome and powerful legacy is something we strive to uphold."
indifference_to_kong_religion:0 "Money over Religion"
indifference_to_kong_religion_desc:0 "When people ask the leaders of Kong, 'What religion do your slaves and workers follow?', they will answer, 'It does not matter. As long as they serve us well, they may worship as they please.'. This mentality has been key in our rise to prominence and will continue to do so since we place more emphasis on money and fighting tactics as opposed to the zealous conversion of our own people."
establish_mercantile_houses:0 "Establishing Mercantile Houses"
establish_mercantile_houses_desc:0 "Whilst the war houses of Kong are plentiful and sometimes a bit hard to control, the increasing flow of trade through our lands means that there should be some system setup so that we can profit in a more systematic manner. Establishing mercantile houses and setting up formal places for merchants to flock to will increase our viability as a trade partner."
money_buys_armies:0 "Buying the Troops Needed"
money_buys_armies_desc:0 "With trade flowing throughout Kong and money flowing in at a greater rate, we can focus on procuring fine warriors from surrounding tribes and states. Mercenary contracts can help fill in the empty ranks within the Kong armies and we have plenty of money to keep them happy."
expanding_kong_merchant_armies:0 "Expansive Merchant Armies"
expanding_kong_merchant_armies_desc:0 "The staying power of mercenaries in Kong armies and the lucrative trade that we profit from has come to make us somewhat reliant on steady mercenary contracts. Though we certainly have our own warriors to rely on, the mercenary contracts for Kong are becoming increasingly regulated and easy to come by."
formal_royal_houses:0 "Formal Royal Houses"
formal_royal_houses_desc:0 "Kong's power is firm on the outside to many, but inside it is still somewhat fragile. War houses and mercantile houses are still coming into conflict with each other at times and with each new feud, our power degrades slightly. Let us try to resolve these disputes from the top-down and institute new succession laws with distinct and formal royal houses that all of Kong recognizes."

From the north come traders from the lands of Morocco and from the west, south, and east come traders from the many plains and river systems of West Africa. Keeping Timbuktu as it is and cultivating its greatest parts can only bring more wealth and grandeur to the city and the people who live in it."

center_for_muslim_scholars_desc:0 "From our dusty foundation to now, Muslim scholars have flocked to Timbuktu not only because it is a city of wealth, but also because it was once part of the great Mali Empire. Though now resigned to the texts of history, Malian influence on Timbuktu helped us greatly and the gifts Muslim scholars bring to us is always appreciated."

the_three_madrasas_of_timbuktu_desc:0 "The Sankore, Djinguereber, and Sidi Yaha Madrasas are the three most important centers of learning inside of Timbuktu.

commercial_endeavors_for_us_desc:0 "Whilst our natural progression in terms of commercial wealth is great, we could do better by ensuring that our own merchants are well protected by guards and also educated to a fair degree. The central administration of Timbuktu would be wise to perhaps fund a school of sorts dedicated entirely to training and perfecting the art of being a merchant."

develop_the_gift_of_the_niger_desc:0 "A nickname for our great city has been the 'gift of the Niger', eluding to the fact that we are one of the largest and wealthiest cities along the Niger River. We could use the wealth we gain from our grand capital to develop infrastructure in surrounding areas, especially along the Niger River, and perhaps make a second Timbuktu somewhere along the lines."

secure_the_trans_sahara_trade_desc:0 "Mastering the trade routes across the Sahara is not easy, but those close to it can learn how they flow and where they regularly come through to. As Timbuktu has always been a natural stopping point for some Saharan trade routes for centuries at this point, it is only natural that we become masters of them."
tuareg_connections:0 "Tuareg Connections"
tuareg_connections_desc:0 "The versatile and sometimes hostile Tuareg people of the Sahara and Sahel Region swear fealty to no state for long. They are akin to mercenaries that can strike fear into the hearts of many in Timbuktu, but we can also negotiate with them for their services in protecting our trade caravans and such. It is better to be in good standing with these fearsome people than to be their consistent enemy."

Few can resist the temptation of coming to Bonoman markets, and fewer still will leave empty-handed."
nucleus_at_markets:0 "Markets are our Heart"
nucleus_at_markets_desc:0 "Bonoman cities and towns are not traditionally centered around a palace or military fortress, but rather they are centered around markets where people do business and make money. Whilst strange to other people, it has served us well so far and kept us afloat financially whereas other people suffer when centered around palaces or fortifications, leaving markets to grow much more slowly."
increase_iron_smelting_capacity:0 "More Iron Smelting"
increase_iron_smelting_capacity_desc:0 "Though we do smelt iron ore into iron for other states and people groups around us, there are others who compete with us in this regard. We need to ensure that Bonoman states are competitive with how much iron they produce and how good the iron is in quality, for if we can outdo our neighbors in this regard, we will secure positive trade relations as well as even more wealth."

the_akan_gold_trade_desc:0 "The lucrative Akan Gold Trade is valued by many around the Bonoman states and we are an integral part of it. The once great Mali Empire even invaded our lands to claim hegemony over the Akan Gold Trade, but their influence did not last long since we asserted our own independence not long after they came through. From now into the future, let the Akan Gold Trade bring wealth and stability to those of the Bonoman states!"
taxing_trade_routes:0 "Taxes from Trade"
taxing_trade_routes_desc:0 "The many trade routes that come through our land are valuable in many senses, so why not formalize the taxes we impose upon them? They shouldn't be too high so that they drive away business, but they also shouldn't be too low so that the Bonoman states start suffering financially."
bonoman_blacksmithing:0 "Bonoman Blacksmithing"
bonoman_blacksmithing_desc:0 "Whilst our blacksmiths are used to providing arms to people groups outside of the general vicinity of the Bonoman states, perhaps we can start producing weapons more for our own people. Arming them and training them in a particular style unique to us 'Abron' people could give us a distinct advantage in the future."

unify_the_bonoman_states_desc:0 "For far too long the Abron people have been split into decentralized states that collectively constituted the 'Bonoman nation'.

the_king_of_strength:0 "The King of Strength"
the_king_of_strength_desc:0 "Our king is known as the 'Ya Naa', or, 'King of Strength', which stems from the foundation of the Dagbon state itself by Sitogu.

implement_the_surviving_tengdamba_desc:0 "The tengdamba/tengdana were earth priests who owned the land before the Dagomba people came through and conquered the indigenous people. They resisted us as one might expect and many tengdamba were killed along the way, but the remaining ones have proven to be loyal enough to us that they are being implemented as loyal local administrators and military officers."

invest_in_islamic_matters_desc:0 "Islam is continuing to be a factor in our politics and societal structure, but we are still skeptical as to what to do about it on a large-scale. Investing in the syncretism between our own traditions and Islam is perhaps the best path here since the traditions of Dagbon are deeply entrenched within our people."
centralized_political_structuring:0 "Centralize our Politics"
centralized_political_structuring_desc:0 "Decentralized politics is keeping the Dagbomba people from making serious strides in reformation of administrative matters as well as societal traditions. Continuously we are seeing new ideas spread around us, but we are constantly being challenged by old notions of how to do things that hinder us. We need a concentrated effort to break down barriers and reform parts of the Dagbon state so that new ideas are more readily taken in by us."

Our kin may be scattered about in nearby areas and regions, but they are not independent like we are. As the beacon of hope for the Oromo people, we must rally them to our banners and show them that with enough tenacity and ferocity, a day clear of smoke and blood is possible. Let them flock to us and be part of the only Oromo confederation there is."

abba_boku_style_administration_desc:0 "The traditional democratic method of governance utilized by us, the Oromo people, has been relatively stable and working to bring us prosperity and unity. Under the Gadaa system, every eight years the Oromo people choose by consensus nine leaders known as 'Salgan ya'ii Borana' or, 'the nine Borana assemblies. A leader elected by the Gadaa system is only in power for eight years and the election takes place at the end of that term, and if the Abbaa Gadaa dies whilst in office, the 'bokkuu' (symbol of power) passes to his wife until the end of the term."

settle_the_oromo_feuds_desc:0 "The Oromo migrations have had a debilitating affect on many people groups, including the Oromo themselves. Feuds that were once stowed away flared back up, and new disputes arose as we travelled across the land to where we are today. We must consistently work to settle these disputes and feuds or we will be ripped apart by them in time."

the_position_of_azazi_desc:0 "The azazi (translated as 'the orderer') will be useful to us in the future, serving as one of the leaders of the administration. His position will be overseeing domestic affairs only, maintaining any and all treasuries we have, and managing finances related to the central court of Jimma itself. Such a prestigious and valuable position will attract many good people to our court, so we shall see to it that they are all vetted properly and of Oromo descent."

more_professional_oromo_soldiers_desc:0 "Soldiers of our people come from all walks of life and indeed many are levied to the cause of the military without much in the way of us supplying them proper weaponry or training, but we are learning to do better from how we treat the personal guards that keep the central court and palace defended.

multi_functional_slaves_desc:0 "Slaves in Jimma are not like typical slaves where they work on a plantation or in a mill day in and day out. Instead, slaves in Jimma are still of a considerably low societal clas, but they are able to serve as jailers, market judgers, stewards for the central court's territories, and many other roles. They are a valuable part of Oromo society and continuing this multi-functional role for them will help our state flourish into the future."

great_mosque_of_djenne_desc:0 "Built somewhere between 1200 and 1300 as our tradition tells us, the mosque has slowly become a center of Islamic scholarship and a beacon for traders all around us. Such a symbol of piety is rarely seen in our region and Djenné is truly blessed to have such a great building in our lands.

From July to December, Djenne becomes something of an island and the irrigation of crops around the land becomes possible once more.

adapt_to_changing_trade:0 "Adapting to Evolving Trade"
adapt_to_changing_trade_desc:0 "With coastal trade from the south and west coming into view, we need to be sure that our importance does not decline. Coastal trade is much easier for people to engage in than trade across plains and savannah so we must be ready for when we get a decrease in merchant numbers. By adapting our merchants and our own way of thinking about trade to this evolution in trade in West Africa, we can still have a fighting chance in the world of trade."
refined_adobe_architecture:0 "Refine our Adobe Architecture"
refined_adobe_architecture_desc:0 "Many around us know Djenné for its adobe architecture. The use of mud bricks is well known throughout West Africa and it is a common building material in drier, more arid climates (such as in Djenné) since it is relatively easy to make in large numbers and quite durable in dry conditions. By refining how adobe architecture is done in Djenné, we can reinforce our buildings so that they are stronger and also streamline the process of making mud bricks in general."

They have taken the lessons given to them (both harshly and graciously) by our former overlords and come to develop a very unique and liberal way of thinking that few states around us can claim to have or even imitate.

the_gold_rush_desc:0 "There are interesting reports of gold deposits being found in various parts of California's interior and whilst we cannot verify most of these findings and reports, the ones we can verify can serve to attract a great many settlers and miners to our land. They'll pay as much as they need to get in and start mining for gold, so why not make money off of this influx of possible future businessmen?"

hostile_encounters_along_the_mississippi_desc:0 "Whether at the river itself or nearby at its banks, we have had several hostile encounters that have trained our military to be keenly aware of how to handle the great river we reside upon. Cavalry and artillery take a less prominent role when fighting near the great river and infantry are at the heart of the fighting and it is because of this that our men are some of the most resilient in the region."
regular_river_crossing:0 "Regular River Crossings"
regular_river_crossing_desc:0 "Crossing the great Mississippi River is no easy task for a commander or general, but it can certainly be done with enough supplies and effort. We need to be training our future commanders to navigate river crossings both small and large with ease so that they are able to use river crossings either to their advantage or nullify the major effect it might have on a battle they're engaged in."
starting_of_plantations:0 "Plantations of Louisiana"
starting_of_plantations_desc:0 "Agriculture in Louisiana, especially southward toward the open sea, is hard to cultivate since marshland and swampy terrain is just not suitable for widescale farms and plantations. We need to open up tracts of land in the more hospitable areas of Louisiana and begin the construction of proper plantations and farm estates so that we can start producing food on a large scale. Perhaps in time, we'll start growing other goods too on the new plantations."

sustainable_harbors_desc:0 "In order to have a proper navy, we are going to need suitable harbors and shipyards. This wouldn't be an issue in most other coastal places, but for Louisiana and its wetlands, we need to get creative with our harbors and shipyards. We will need to engineer some well-built structures that can be used on less-than-ideal terrain and once we obtain some good coastal lands, we need to ensure that our harbors and shipyards there are also built in a very similar fashion."
vie_for_gulf_control:0 "The Battles for the Gulf"
vie_for_gulf_control_desc:0 "Controlling the trade in the gulf to our immediate south is a priority of ours since a lot of our trade comes through there. If we can secure it with our own ships and fend off hostile powers, both other independent nations of the New World and old nations from beyond the ocean, we will be in a grand position to command all the trade around us."
the_marshland_masters:0 "Marshland Masters"
the_marshland_masters_desc:0 "What fighting we've done and what civil cultivation of the land we've done in the harsh terrain of Louisiana has trained us to be resilient and hardworking people. Our former colonial masters may think of us as little upstarts who need to get back in line eventually, but we'll show them just how wrong they are about the Lousianian people. Let them land on our shores, and let them drown in their own blood mixed with the water."

harbinger_of_the_mississippi_river_desc:0 "The great Mississippi River is a very defining feature of the region we reside in and it is perhaps the key defining factor about Louisiana itself. So many people depend on it for their own lives and for making money off of trade, we would be fools to try to close it down to only ourselves. We should be attracting any and all merchants that we can and invite them in so that they too can share in the glory of the mighty Mississippi River."

confederation_vs_federation:0 "Confederation, or Federation?"
confederation_vs_federation_desc:0 "Many within Argentina debate as to how the provinces should be governed from the central administrative body and roughly they fall into two categories: Unitarians and Federalists. Whether we choose the path of confederation as endorsed by the Unitarians, or a federal system as proposed by the Federalists, we will need to defend Argentina from outside threats and colonial powers attempting to snuff out the fires of Argentine liberty; in this respect, there are no shortage of fighters ready and willing to take up arms for their own independence."

defeat_secessionits_movements_desc:0 "Argentina is not a uniform and neat nation that can be easily governed, not at all.

suppress_counter_revolutionaries_desc:0 "Some say it is not possible, but reality is so rarely what we want it to be. There are some who would indeed rise up against Argentina and return it to the greedy hands of our former colonial overlords. These counter-revolutionaries are some of the worst threats to Argentina and we will need to fight them off at every turn when they rise up. They lack the faith that others do in an independent Argentina; we will show they just how wrong they are."

watch_for_caudillos_desc:0 "Caudillos, a taboo word of sorts in our land. It stands for militarist politician who seeks to govern from the top down according to his will and those with unflinching loyalty to him. We need to watch for these abhorrent people rising up in the ranks of the Argetine administration, for if they have their way with the government, the entire dream of an independent and unified Argentina could easily collapse in on itself."

chilean_finances_desc:0 "Chile has had to struggle with had financial times for a while since the lands of Chile are not blessed with great wealth like those in other parts of South America. This struggle has helped Chilean economists and financiers learn how to minimize spending and maximize profit for what little good land we have, and more importantly they have learned how to streamline military spending so that there is little in the way of wasted funds."

establish_chilean_schooling_desc:0 "What our officials know better than anyone else around us is that an educated populace is a more well-off populace. Social mobility can be had more easily with education and as such Chilean schools and libraries need to be promoted whenever possible. Building new ones in our largest cities and radiating out from there will be a fine start."
appeal_to_tolerance_not_tradition:0 "Who Needs a State Religion?"
appeal_to_tolerance_not_tradition_desc:0 "Chile's foundation may be steeped in the fires of colonial independence movements, but Chile must also think about its future and not simply be stuck in the past. Previously we saw state religions enforced everywhere we looked, but does Chile truly need a state religion? We must be more liberal minded about this and appeal more to tolerance as opposed to tradition, for that (being more liberal minded) is what helped us gain independence in the first place."
spearhead_liberal_ideas:0 "Spearheading Liberal Ideas"
spearhead_liberal_ideas_desc:0 "The mindset of being liberal with many things in life is alien to many of our former overlords, but in Chile, it is widely embraced.

balance_the_political_scales_desc:0 "As the political landscape in Chile develops, there is a real threat that disputes in politics could erupt into civil conflicts that involve armies moving against each other.

reforming_the_paraguayan_economy:0 "Reformation of the Economy"
reforming_the_paraguayan_economy_desc:0 "Independence for Paraguay is a tricky matter since our region is not the most profitable nor the most valuable. We must become more financially responsible and fiscally viable so that the economy of Paraguay can be in consistent growth rather than stagnation or decline, and how do we do this? Through active reform efforts ranging from coinage reforms to trade policy revisions."

Alas, our day had finally come and gone and revolutionary fervor peaked when our independence was at hand, but what now? We cannot let that flame of liberty just die away, we must keep the torch lit so that other nations of the Americas may follow our path! We can help our brothers and sisters across the continent be free from colonial oppression!"

Raiding on land and at sea and taking off before the enemy can catch you, it's dishonorable and harsh in all the right ways! These tactics that we employed in our fight for independence should become regular strategies we use in whatever battle we find ourselves in!"

In previous eras it was dominated by the Hanseatic League stemming from Northern Germany, but Scandinavians as well as Russians have always had a hand in Baltic trade as well. Now that Scandinavia is united, we should be putting forth our merchants and mercantile fleets all throughout the Baltic to secure more and more trade for ourselves, denying our rivals of the valuable income that stems from the trade routes in what should be referred to as the 'Scandinavian Sea'."

We must learn to innovate and make do with what we already do have and extract all that we can and more from our soldiers. Thus, our military strategies and battle tactics are going to need to take a turn toward offense instead of defense, trading pure staying power through sheer numbers for professional and disciplined men of great caliber, and the Swedish sector of Scandinavia will help lead this charge into a new military era."

Monarchs may indeed be checked by the people they rule over, but the entirety of the administration needs to have its laws heard and followed by every town and city of significant standing within Scandinavia's borders.

Norwegian people though, unlike those of Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and the far north, are much more adept at sailing through the open waters. Whether it is because of our innate love for the open waters or our strategic homeland position along the North Sea, the bulk of our great sailors will hail from Norwegian cities and they will lead us toward glory."

Longships were crafted specifically toward the environment they were going to be sailing in and also could be used as steady platforms for man-to-man fighting on the open water. Their grand design and high value back then gives all of Scandinavia something to look back upon, and most importantly it gives the Norwegian engineers and shipbuilders inspiration to innovate on current ship designs so that our future fleets will be sturdier and more robust than anything our foes can muster."

None could have envisioned what it would do to shape our politics and foreign relations, but it succeeded in its main goal: stopping German expansion northward into the Baltic Sea and into Scandinavian lands. The union as a whole was not smooth though, and there were many issues between the three main people groups of the union that eventually pulled it apart from every possible angle. We will learn from this period in our history and institute reforms so that a union like it will never fall apart again."

Trying to unify the lands of Scandinavia and the Isles is a monumental task and the failure of Cnut's successors is shameful, but valuable in what it left behind: a legacy of conquest. The blood of the Danish people is not satisfied with simply being the leading part of Scandinavia, no, it strives to expand outward and to retake what rightfully belongs to Scandinavian people and more!"

Why is this? It is because we know that they too have ideas and thoughts that need to be heard just like those of the nobility and the merchants of Scandinavia. Extending this mindset across our government can and will help make it more flexible and able to address the concerns of many people groups inside our borders."

finland_extensive_defenses_desc:0 "Whilst the White Death is what keeps the lands of Scandinavia's northern sector fairly secure, it is the job of staunch fortifications like the one at Viborg to hold off enemies in warmer climates. If we can build stronger and more extensive defenses throughout Scandinavia whilst also utilizing the seasons to our advantage, there will be no nation in the world that can penetrate beyond just a couple provinces into Scandinavia's heartland."
sapmi_swift_movements:0 "Swift Movements"
sapmi_swift_movements_desc:0 "If there is one thing that the Sapmi people of the north have instilled into the hearts and minds of the military officers of Scandinavia, it is that fast and precise movement is absolutely crucial. The Land of the Midnight Sun has no mercy on those who wait too long and the same rule applies to enemies in war. Mobility will be the largest factor in driving military success for Scandinavians."
sapmi_noaidi_traditions:0 "The Noaidi Traditions"
sapmi_noaidi_traditions_desc:0 "The fires of religious war in Europe's heart is a raging inferno that the Sapmi have wanted no part in. The noaidi, Sapmi shamans who are the religious heads of the polytheisitic Sapmi religion, bring a much needed example of tolerance in the times of religious turmoil. We can look to them for guidance and learn to accept other faiths into the fold of Scandinavia without compromising its ability to govern or defend itself from invasions."

sapmi_fairness_to_nomads_and_settlers_desc:0 "Many of the Sapmi people are content with their semi-nomadic reindeer herding in the far north of Scandinavia. Though some Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish officials think it would be better if we forced these semi-nomadic people to settle down, we realize that it is in the best interest of Scandinavia if they keep to their own and are treated fairly under the government. They can help keep order in their own parts of Scandinavia if they are treated fairly and we will ensure that there is a permanent peace between the nomads and settlers of Scandinavia."
ice_ruthless_fleet:0 "The Ruthless Fleet"
ice_ruthless_fleet_desc:0 "The fleets of Scandinavia that dock not only in the cold ports of Iceland and the warmer ports along the Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian coast knows no bounds. Shaped from having to fend off countless commerce raids and various conflicts throughout the North Sea and elsewhere, the fleet of Scandinavia will be like no other, for when one ship falls in battle, it only grows more bolder in its actions in the heat of things."
ice_norse_endurance:0 "Norse Endurance"
ice_norse_endurance_desc:0 "If we can endure the cold weather of Scandinavia stretching from the Land of the Midnight Sun all the way to Icelandic mountains and fjords, what can't we endure? Sure the enemy may tire out our armies in battle and seek to invade our lands, but Scandinavian people know that they must not give in and they must never give the enemy any advantage if possible. We fight to the very end, just as our Norse ancestors did."
ice_althing_legislation:0 "Legacy of the Althing"
ice_althing_legislation_desc:0 "The Althing, though somewhat outdated in these modern times, can still be useful on the local level of things. Icelandic ways of governance might be foreign to some Finnish, Sapmi, and Danish people, but we can introduce them to it over time and work on refining how the Althing functions as time goes on. It would certainly help build up a robust local governance structure that we can rely on."
krl_ice_cold_defensive_measures:0 "Defending Every Piece of Scandinavia"
krl_ice_cold_defensive_measures_desc:0 "There are pieces of land we hold that are not always blanketed by snow and cold weather, which means they are more vulnerable to invasion and thus require more defensive attention. With our roots being generally defensive in both political and military matters, knowing exactly how to build fortifications in these warmer climates should come naturally to us. If anything, we can utilize older Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish designs and combine aspects of them with the fortification designs seen more so amongst Karelians."
krl_spirit_for_home_not_conquest:0 "Inner Priorities"
krl_spirit_for_home_not_conquest_desc:0 "The constant political controversies and shifts in regions to our south are worrying to some degree, but we should not let these potential issues distract us from cultivating an internal focus. Once our borders are secure and our officers and admirals can keep us safe from invasion, the questions of how to govern our slowly growing urban centers must take center stage. Inheritance laws and specific methods of production are just some of the issues that Scandinavians of both high and low status will need to contend with as time goes on."
krl_fostering_cohesive_internal_ties:0 "Justified Scandinavian Politics"
krl_fostering_cohesive_internal_ties_desc:0 "It is through honest and methodical political actions by one Scandinavian leader after another that we have obtained the sort of smooth flow of politics we currently enjoy. Other leaders in Europe might look at our government of officials speaking everything from Karelian to Danish and wonder how anything can get done, but we have gone where very few others have before: growing and refining a system of governance that relies not on divine right or absolutism alone, but rather the combined efforts from all social classes within the state itself."
norse_the_northern_routes_once_more:0 "The Old Routes, Rekindled"
norse_the_northern_routes_once_more_desc:0 "There are many who have forgotten the old routes of the north that went past Iceland. Interest in places like Markland, Helluland, and Vinland ceased for several generations, but now that Scandinavia is unified in both its politics and its external focuses, these northern routes will be rekindled once more. Ships carrying vast quantities of Norse settlers both young and old will travel these cold waters knowing that wait awaits them is good land and profitable endeavors."

norse_recalling_the_memory_of_jomsvikings_desc:0 "Obscured by the sags of old that are told and retold by generations of our people, the old groups of dedicated warriors that served the heavens above are examples to be looked up to. Several of our recruits and would-be soldiers are eager to embody the tales of these great warriors of the past, but first we must ensure that there are proper guidelines that such militant orders follow. Keeping a steady hand in control of them will allow all of Scandinavia to benefit from the militant fervor they generate."
norse_hardiest_and_deadliest_warriors:0 "Strength through the Gods"
norse_hardiest_and_deadliest_warriors_desc:0 "It is not enough to cultivate a strong physique through manual labor or a strong mind through strenuous studies. In our land and our traditions, one should also rely on the heavens above for strength in all walks of life but none more so than warfare as a whole. To give your all in the heat of battle not only for your clan or your family, but also for your the gods and goddesses above, that is what true strength looks like."
norse_flowing_artisan_works:0 "Business in Every Direction"
norse_flowing_artisan_works_desc:0 "As much as some states both near and far detest our practices and traditions, many won't deny that the business contracts we engage are some of the best around. Not only do we control a fair amount of crucial trade routes and ports, we have eager artisans that are looking to utilize the materials and designs from other parts of Europe and beyond. It is thus only natural for us to lean on mercantile matters more and more as Europeans become accustom to our presence and the increasing abundance of Scandinavian artistry."
norse_a_new_viking_age_dawns:0 "Making the New Age"
norse_a_new_viking_age_dawns_desc:0 "The age when our ancestors dominated the North Sea and made incursions in places across Europe and beyond made for legends that are still told to this day. Much has changed since then as no longer do we have great adventuring leaders taking off for distant lands to settle down in, but that ancestral spirit for naval combat and adventure is very much still alive in every single Scandinavian person. Our people regularly volunteer from villages and towns to assist Scandinavian sailors when it comes to coastal combat or resupplying their ships; it is as if they are seeking that thrill of the past but much closer to home."

We of Florida will gladly welcome these escaped people to our state and open our borders to them if they agree to some initial paperwork to formalize their entry. The more people we have, the better!"

marshland_fighting_desc:0 "Florida's heartland is a humid places with very little in the way of mercy from the damp and hot climate. The natives here were used to the conditions and put up a fierce fight when we came to colonize the region and not long after we arrived, we learned just how crucial their fighting styles would be to our own survival. Fighting in the marshes is no easy task, but we are masters of it at this point and are able to resist massed musket fire like no other."

Whole communities can come down with debilitating diseases because of these menacing pests coupled with the heat and indeed we've lost thousands to them in the past, but it is through these painful experiences that we grow stronger. We are developing methods to stave off the threat of insects as well as to mitigate the impact that the heat and humidity has. Our civilians as well as our soldiers must adapt over time to how harsh this land is."

formalize_hemp_sugarcane_indigo_growth_desc:0 "Our land is ripe for growing hemp, sugar, and indigo, but we can only utilize so much of the land for our crops before trying to go to war for more land. Perhaps we can expand our reach inland and carve out more places for plantations and farms through land development. It'll take years to do, but in time we should see a general rise in how much we produce and how well our economy can do on the world stage."
scattered_yet_plentiful_fortifications:0 "Outposts and Watchtowers"
scattered_yet_plentiful_fortifications_desc:0 "Castles and bastions with great walls of stone are few and far between in the Floridian heartland since the ground to build on is often wet, unstable, and prone to changes over the years. That is why we build several fortified outposts and watchtowers equipped with skilled shooters and runners for communication, and on top of all that these defensive structures are much easier to build than a normal castle. We'd do well to continue building these light defenses in the future to help slow down any advancing enemies."
floridian_harbors:0 "Floridian Harbors"
floridian_harbors_desc:0 "Whilst we have marshy terrain all around our heartland, we have waters of all kinds around us that are fit for trade and combat. Being that so much potential for Florida lies not just in its land and people but also out at sea, we should be keen on building up suitable harbors and docks for our fleet of ships. There is plenty of suitable coastline to start with so, we're already a step ahead of some regions nearby."

social_mobility_for_slaves_and_natives_desc:0 "Natives and freed slaves in our lands cannot be held back forever by our culture and government since they can provide so much in the form of taxes, production, and military manpower. If we build schools and libraries, we can also help these people rise through the society to become great Floridian administrators, but in order for any of this to happen, we need to embark on a policy of change and reform that staunchly encourages social mobility."

combat_against_natives_desc:0 "Though it hasn't been often that we of Illinois are needed to fight extensively, we have been called upon to defend our own settlements from various native tribes in the past and even to this day. We must be sure that we have enough troops to man the defensive structures we have and to also do battle with any enemy force that seeks to destroy what we've worked so hard to build up over the decades."

utilize_water_ways_desc:0 "Rivers, where would be without rivers? They're a great way of transporting goods to far away places with less work (most of the time), they provide a source of water to us, and they also help indicate where other potentially friendly settlements might be. The more we can use the rivers to our advantage in terms of trade and business deals, the better off we will be as a whole."
tenuous_borders:0 "Finding the Real Borders"
tenuous_borders_desc:0 "Due to where we are situated, borders are less cut-and-dry compared to other places that are more heavily inhabited by dense cities and dedicated roads. As a result, we're often redefining where our borders are at the local level with various communities and towns on the border with our neighbors. When push comes to shove and war breaks out though, we can use this to our advantage and use some very favorable maps at the peace conference that allow us to take even more land."

wealth_over_war_desc:0 "If we can avoid war, we'd rather do so than take our chances with our economy and investments.

The gold and silver we've brought into our treasury and the wealth we've created for our citizens, it will not be robbed by the greedy hands of war or other disasters.

Because of this, we have gained a great number of settlers over the decades both before and after our independence. These settlers will be useful in not only expanding Cuban military measures and economic aspects, but they will also help develop new settlements all across our central island and beyond."

centralize_governance_in_cuba_desc:0 "Cuba is a place of splendor and majesty, but also a place of strong central authority and governance. Even before we gained independence, we had a strong administration that oversaw the entirety of Cuban domains so that the rise in the amount of settlers coming to our land would be organized properly.

Cuba is not safe without a navy nor a military, but if we cannot protect our coasts from imperial colonizers like our former overlord, what good are we as a nation?

trade_with_new_world_polities_desc:0 "With our independence secured and the wars for independence raging on throughout the various parts of the New World, we should take the time to start investing in these upcoming states who are fighting for their own rights and values. We are a much better trade partner for them than the colonial overlords that seek only to extract wealth from colonial entities, so we can go forth with some safety knowning that we will be seen in a more favorable light."
learn_advanced_naval_strategy:0 "Uphold the Cuban Fleet"
learn_advanced_naval_strategy_desc:0 "Naval strategy and the perfection of it over time is tough, but Cuba is uniquely situated to be at the forefront of this endeavor. Defending our waters and engaging in various wars that involve conflicts on the high seas will continually breed stronger and more adept admirals and sailors who know exactly what to do in the midst of a broadside battle. We have faith that our fleet can withstand whatever comes their way in the future."

Instead, they will find a population of righteous people armed with muskets and rifles, willing to fight to keep the liberty that was gained so many years ago.

Few other places have the resource that can make such brilliant red dye and it is because of this rarity and how we use the red dye that others come to see us as a better diplomatic partner. Perhaps red can become the standard royalty?"

diarchical_administration_desc:0 "Ichma administration is divided into two parts roughly: the 'anan (upper) saya ichma' and the 'luran (lower) saya ichma', which represent the upper communities in the highlands and the lower communities closer to the coast. Because the coastal communities are much more vital to the survival of our state, they have traditionally held more sway over government matters, but we must work to continually enforce balanced legislative rules and pass laws that benefit all communities when possible."

Through his work of leading the second revival of Buddhism in Tibetan lands, sponsoring novice monastic people to travel to different lands, and constructing some of the most revered monuments in all of Tibet, we of Guge are well known and have gained a great amount of influence. But, his work was not militarily secured and Guge remained a rather small kingdom despite his grandeur, thus leaving us with merely prestigious structures that survive to now such as the three monasteries."

The form of Buddhism that took root in Tibet changed and morphed over the centuries due to various influences such as shifting borders in the Tarim Basin and ambitions to conquer land whilst also controlling politics at home in the mountainous cities of Lhasa, Dege, Shigatse, and many others. When it looked like the flame of Buddhism in our land was about to be extinguished, it was the rulers of Guge who gave renewed life to the flame, and it is this period of revival that many still know us for."

Few if any can be truly honest if they are selected by members outside of our administration, meaning we are going to need to overhaul the way we govern as time goes on to better enforce laws that come directly from the Rinpungpa dynasty.

Not only this, but he also recognized the first Samding Dorja Phagmo, the highest female incarnation in Tibet and the third highest-ranking persion in the hierarchy after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. On top of all of this, he founded the Iron Chain leneage of the Shangpa Kagyu school, thus furthering his work and influence. Truly, Thangtong is a reincarnation of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen."

If we are ambitious enough, we can capitalize on the destruction of the losing side and make valuable gains for all of Kara Del, but we will have to be strategic about when and where we strike.

It is not easy choosing one religion over the other as Kara Del has populations of all three in its land, but we can at least try to make do in tolerating all three whenever possible. Promoting a stance of tolerance will undoubtedly lend to a greater amount of people flocking to our stable banner."

Instead, the original Quitu people were conquered some centuries ago by people of the Cara culture, but the conquest did not bring about great death and destruction as one might think. Instead, it brought about a combining of cultures into a product that is greater than its previous individual parts. This Quitu-Cara culture that sprang forth is what we are today and it is what we draw power from in our administration and in our military."

integrate_the_others_into_quito_desc:0 "Over time, we are learning to accept and work with people who speak different languages and perform different rituals. Some words blend together over the decades and centuries, some rituals become closer together in how they are performed, and eventually the bond of common kinship is formed as these people join hands with our own.

They came back and struck a blow against us so hard it almost made the entirety of Yao collapse in on itself, but we managed to hold ourselves firm despite this devasation.

citadel_of_kokand_desc:0 "Kokand itself has been our starting point and the place from which we project power from. Though it was not so grand at its start, we have worked hard to build up its defensive structures so that raids and attacks against us would yield little results. Even though we rely heavily on old khanate traditions, there is some wisdom in keeping certain positions locked down and heavily fortified."
tajik_mercenary_fighters:0 "Tajik Mercenaries"
tajik_mercenary_fighters_desc:0 "Mercenaries around us are plentiful and always willing to fight if we have the money to spend, and in particular the Tajik people are usually offering Uzbek states and khanates lower prices than other states due to our familial connections. Taking advantage of these blood ties can be advantageous for us when we are in a tight spot and in the future we can expand the connections we have to other mercenary groups around the steppe."
swift_conquest_around_the_oxus:0 "In and Around the Oxus River"
swift_conquest_around_the_oxus_desc:0 "The Oxus River has been stage for a number of states that came before us and it has seen countless conquests from a variety of people. We are going to continue this tradition and conquer land just like our ancestors have, leaving fire and blood behind us as our people march forth, banner in one hand and musket in the other."
the_khojas_of_kashgar:0 "The Kashgar Khojas"
the_khojas_of_kashgar_desc:0 "Khojas (meaning 'master' in Persian) are people who are descedants of the Naqshabandi Sufi teacher named Amad Kasani (1461-1542). At various points they have seen rises in power throughout Central Asia since they have been favored local and regional administrators. Perhaps we could use their service too and appoint various khojas to positions of authority in Kokand... After ensuring that they are loyal to us, of course."
preventing_civil_wars:0 "Prevent Collapses"
preventing_civil_wars_desc:0 "Like most other khanates we too are prone to collapse from internal strife and succession crises. Reforming laws of succession are tough as it is, but Kokand is in need of strong central authority that has an administrative body built around it, not just a lone holder of power that rules through blood and iron. If Kokand is to survive into the future, there will need to be hefty changes to our old traditions."
unify_the_uzbek_people:0 "Uzbek Unity"
unify_the_uzbek_people_desc:0 "Our kin that lie around the Aral Sea and west of the Tarim Basin, the Uzbek people, are rather disunited and longing for leadership that can tame their various clans. Whilst Kokand is by no means the first contender in this matter, it can strive to be the final unifying state that comes out on top and unites all of the Uzbek people into a solidified state. Doing so would bring not only unparalleled prosperity, but also a great sense of joy to the various Uzbek people."
a_settled_khanate:0 "Changing Times, Changing People"
a_settled_khanate_desc:0 "We cannot deny that our traditions of khans and steppe riders are becoming outdated more and more. To our south in the lands of Persia, we see sprawling cities such as Herat and Samarkand that thrive off trade and production from hard working and settled citizens; to our north and east, the endless steppe yields the same things century after century with very little change. Perhaps it is time we strike the earth and plant our banner in it once and for all, settling our people down slowly and founding new cities for the entirety of Kokand."

dualistic_governing_body_desc:0 "Much like other polities in the mountains we come from, our governing body is dualistic in its nature with both parts working together to govern the land in harmony but also recognizing that one side is superior to the other. Over time, we can reform this tradition into a more centralized version that still keeps true to what our ancestors set up in past ages."

sacred_shrine_of_lake_titikaka_desc:0 "The shrine at Lake Titikaka is inhabited by our people and is held sacred by many people groups throughout the mountains and hills around us. Keeping its sanctity and keeping the land around the lake safe will help bring more faithful followers to our state."

the_three_colla_people_groups_desc:0 "The three main groups of people that make up the various cities and dominions of the Aymara people are the Colla, the Puquina, and the Uro. All three hold various amounts of power depending on what city you travel to and gaining the loyalty of all three is a must if we are to have a decent sized fighting force."
contesting_the_mountain_territories:0 "Contest for the Mountains"
contesting_the_mountain_territories_desc:0 "The mountains breed warfare unlike any other place around us since, even though the terrain might be rough and air might be thin, the will of the lords and kings to fight for power never ceases despite what happens. As we go forth, our people will become addept in mountain tactics and movements in and around hills to the point that we will be able to outdo any enemy that stands in our way."

bring_up_urcosuyu_and_umasuyu_desc:0 "The two regions of Urcosuyu and Umasuyu are more so administrative divisions for us and are the basis by which we are reforming our laws of the land. By establishing these regions more firmly with inheritance laws and stronger local authorities, we will be able to develop the lands more more easily."
earth_work_defenses:0 "Earthen Defenses"
earth_work_defenses_desc:0 "Much like other people groups around us, the defenses of our land are made of earthen materials like stone and mud bricks.

successor_to_tiwanaku_desc:0 "The old polity of Tiwanaku that came before us, its memory has faded a great deal by now. Still, some traditions and tales live on from those olden times when Tiwanaku was around and in large part we are the only embodiment of a successor to Tiwanaku. If it falls to only us being around to succeed where they left off, then let us do so."

Glimmers of light have shown this in the past, but still we remember the fighting and feuds that always brought down these hopes. Let us never forget the times of warfare before we were unified into our current state."
etsu_nupe:0 "Etsu Nupe"
etsu_nupe_desc:0 "The Etsu Nupe, or, King of the Nupe, is a title that has been claimed before and is claimed now, sure, but there must be solid backing behind it. We are consistently working on building up our base of power in terms of military potential, but at the same time we are working to solve age-old disputes our leader and his lineage may have with other Nupe clans and tribes."
traditional_customs_with_islam:0 "To Share in Faith"
traditional_customs_with_islam_desc:0 "We share many religious customs with several people groups around us, but this new faith called 'Islam' is increasingly coming forth to Nupe communities and their preachers seem intent on converting us. Whilst we will resist full conversion of this suspicious new religion, some of our friends and allies have taken up Islam and been completely fine with it; perhaps we could see what this faith has to offer us."
the_nupe_hero_tsoede:0 "The Legacy of Tsoede"
the_nupe_hero_tsoede_desc:0 "If there is one figure in Nupe history that we look up to, it is Tsoede, the great unifier of Nupe people. Him and his men unified the 12 villages (Tafie, Bida, Doko, Esa, Nupeko, Eda, Towagi, Egbe, Ewu, Yesa, Gaba, and Panjuru) into a single loose political entity and helped assimilate people who crossed over into Nupe territory. We will learn from his example and keep his memory alive through stories and art as we go forth into the future."
assimilate_the_border_people:0 "Taking in the Border People"
assimilate_the_border_people_desc:0 "There are a variety of people on our border as the border itself is not concrete; it is porous and can be freely passed through at times by a variety of people. Thus, we find a great number of settlements at our borders and these people do not speak our language or share many Nupe cultural traits. Perhaps bringing our traditions and culture to them will help cement their fealty and loyalty to us and bring them closer to being true Nupe people."
power_through_marriages_and_kinship:0 "The Power of Kin"
power_through_marriages_and_kinship_desc:0 "Bringing together two different sides through the act of marriage is at times a great way to ease tensions and we of Nupe are keen on making sure these marriages go smoothly. Whether they are internal families who have feuds with us or foreign families who are potential allies, securing valuable marriages with a variety of people will spread the influence of the Nupe far and wide."
fight_back_against_islamic_conquest:0 "Clashes against Islam"
fight_back_against_islamic_conquest_desc:0 "Islam may have its good parts and may be somewhat present in Nupe lands, but there are political entities that take Islam to the worst degree possible and wage war against us in the name of it. We will not stand by and watch our fields burn and men die in vain, no, we will rally against these unjust wars and fight back with all that we can."

spa_influences_of_catholicism_desc:0 "Catholicism in Iberia, there almost nothing that is quite as natural as this, and with the fires of the Protestant Reformation making Europe a pool of different forms of Christianity that turn away from the one true faith, Iberia is perhaps the only bastion of righteous Catholicism left. This will not break our spirit, but rather it will embolden us to do more in the name of Christ and the Holy See!"
spa_high_seas_fleet:0 "Armada of the Spanish"
spa_high_seas_fleet_desc:0 "Iberia has had to deal with coastal raids and threats form the sea for centuries and it has taught the various people of the peninsula to build up what naval forces they can to combat foreigners intruding on their land. Whether they be Portuguese sailors, Castilian admirals, Aragonese builders, or even Galician cartographers, we will ensure that every single part of our future armada will be specifically built to uphold the coastal integrity of Spain."
spa_strong_colonial_authority:0 "The Watchful Eyes of Spain"
spa_strong_colonial_authority_desc:0 "Our subjects, be they viceroys, small dukes, or local governors, know that the Spanish crown is always keen on hearing them out for what they need and what they have to say. Listening to what our subjects need is crucial to keeping them loyal, but we must also watch their every action that we possibly can should a corrupt subject attempt to collude with the enemies of Spain. There will be none who evade our watchful eyes."
spa_tercio_reformation:0 "Reformation of the Tercios"
spa_tercio_reformation_desc:0 "The tercios of old were innovative when they were first introduced, but as time has gone on there have been innovations in various fields that have allowed foreign infantry and cavalry to take out our tercios. Reformation is needed on the surface of things, and not only this but new tactics revolving around new technology must be integrated with our tercios if Spain is every going to be a true and proper military power."
por_feitorias:0 "Promote Feitorias"
por_feitorias_desc:0 "From our formative days as Portugal to where we are now as Spain, the feitorias around the world for us have been nothing but grand for goal of making more money through trade. Increasing the amount built and perhaps even converting a few into actual Spanish trading colonies could yield untold amounts of benefits for us as well."
por_marines:0 "Spanish Marines"
por_marines_desc:0 "The days as Portugal taught out soldiers that attacking coastal settlements from ships is something that takes time and training to master. Being a marine in the Spanish military is nothing short of an honor as it signifies that they are truly ready to be on the front of Spain's wars and colonies, fighting from coast to coast in order to secure what is rightfully ours."
por_trade_monopolies:0 "Monopolized"
por_trade_monopolies_Desc:0 "There is only one power that can make more money from trade than we can and that power is Venice, but they are locked into the Mediterranean Sea whilst we of Spain are free to take our interests beyond the shores of the inland sea. We will monopolize what markets we can in the world and ensure that Spanish trade interests satisfied by our merchants."
cas_the_inquisition:0 "The Spanish Inquisition!"
cas_the_inquisition_desc:0 "Whether through promises of salvation, sending a few spare coins their way, or making them feel the pain that Christ felt when he was on the cross, the Spanish Inquisition will work to enforce the Catholic faith throughout Spain and its holdings. Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition to come forth and bring unity to the masses, but they will indeed do this through the power of righteous faith and sanctioned methods."
cas_reformation_of_cabildos:0 "Reformation of the Cabildos"
cas_reformation_of_cabildos_desc:0 "Though the cabildo may be used to help represent the various land owners in a certain province, it is routinely vulnerable to corruption via the people running it since they are more or less governors of an entire area away from central Spanish authority. We must work to reform the cabildos into a stronger institution that can represent the various Spanish people properly and without colored glasses shaping what we see beneath the cabildo."
cas_far_reaching_spanish_people:0 "Every Continent, a Spanish Flag"
cas_far_reaching_spanish_people_desc:0 "Some would say that the Spanish people are spilling into whatever land they can for the sake of spreading out, but this is a simplistic way of seeing our endeavors. In reality, we strive to influence what politics we can in the favor of Spanish interests, and part of doing that means colonizing lands all across the world with strong Spanish communities."
ara_mercenary_princes:0 "Princely Mercenaries"
ara_mercenary_princes_desc:0 "Aragonese roots bring with them a plethora of mercenary connections as our past princes have been made to lead various mercenary companies both in and out of Iberia. Though we are steadily cutting down on how many mercenaries we use, these ties to various mercenary companies could indeed be useful for us in the future if Spain is in a tight spot."
ara_charter_companies:0 "Charter Companies of Spain"
ara_charter_companies_desc:0 "Why must we colonize everything with valuable Spanish families when we can instead cultivate our interests through charter companies that are supported by our military at times? Surely this method of expanding Spanish influence will bring about increased profit for us later on and few will be able to resist the pull of Spanish markets."
ara_centralized_estates:0 "Command the Spanish Estates"
ara_centralized_estates_desc:0 "As for what can be done with Spanish land directly underneath the crown... Well, unruly estates must be put back in line, should they not? For too long we have seen the clergy and the nobility run their own local affairs without Spanish interests being at their heart which has led to various struggles for power that boil upwards to the monarch. It is time we take firm control over these estates and make them bow to the Spanish crown once and for all."
lon_the_true_iberian:0 "Truth in our Blood"
lon_the_true_iberian_desc:0 "The people of Leon and those of Leonese descent know that they are indeed the true holders of Iberia and were destined to be as such had it not been for the fiends of Castile stealing power away from the leaders of Leon. Now that we are unified with the true blood of the Leonese leading the way, there will very few who can question our authority."
lon_dominant_leonese_dialect:0 "The Leonese Dialect"
lon_dominant_leonese_dialect_desc:0 "Much like how the Castilians slowly spread their dialect throughout their lands, Leonese will now spread throughout the land we hold and steadily assimilate other languages into it. Perhaps in the future, we can even form a foundation of sorts dedicated to keeping our language enforced without much change over time."
lon_schools_of_iberia:0 "Schools of Iberia"
lon_schools_of_iberia_desc:0 "To further promote the intellectual pursuits of Spanish people and to keep them on par with the likes of the rest of Europe, we must be keen on building libraries, schools, and universities all across Iberia.

gal_santiago_de_compostela_desc:0 "The city of Santiago de Compostela, grand is it not? Holding the fabeled Way of St. James's ending, the city is very much a pilgramage site for Catholics around Europe and it has led to a great deal of zealousness amongst our missionaries and priests. We need to keep them reined in as time goes on, but their zeal should not be left to wither away in our lands; they can safely promote the faith in our own land when it is needed."

gal_bishoprics_of_iberia_desc:0 "The bishoprics were once a key factor in the politics of Iberia and at times, clergy officials could easily hold sway over certain parts of kingdoms and duchies. The time has come to centralize power toward the crown of Spain, but we can still find use in these old bishoprics when it comes to hiring good leaders to help organize our military. They had experience with doing such in centuries past, why can't they help us out now?"
gal_righteous_catholic_bastion:0 "The Rightous Bastion"
gal_righteous_catholic_bastion_desc:0 "The Spanish people are and have always been righteous defenders of Catholicism throughout their time on the peninsula as independent entities. From the times of Asturias and Galicia to the times of Portugal and Aragon, our people have been loyal to the one true faith, garnering us a rather fitting reputation as a defender of the faith."
cat_luxury_of_iberia:0 "Luxuries of Iberia"
cat_luxury_of_iberia_desc:0 "Iberia is full of luxury goods if one can search for them in the right markets and the right communities.

cat_harbor_emphasis:0 "Emphasize the Harbors"
cat_harbor_emphasis_desc:0 "The various harbors of Iberia are alright for now, but they need to be built up even further later on if we are to compete with the likes of the French, the English, and the Italians! Catalan cities on the coast are perhaps some of the best for building ships and promoting naval interests for Spain so those should be prioritized first, and then harbors around the rest of Iberia should be focused on."
cat_mercantile_expertise:0 "Mercnatile Lens on the World"
cat_mercantile_expertise_desc:0 "Emphaisis on our Catalan heritage makes us more keen on trade and naval dominance as one might expect. The glistening cities of Barcelona and Valencia are what we should be striving to make throughout all Spanish lands, and within these cities shall be grand markets that have trade power on levels the Venetians and Genoese could only dream of."
nav_rugged_terrain_traders:0 "Cross-Region Traders"
nav_rugged_terrain_traders_desc:0 "The Basque people are a strange sort of people in Iberia, but they're influential in mercantile politics as well as dynastic politics. These Basque connections in the French region and the in the lands of the English and Irish could be just the thing that Spain needs to profit hugely, though it will take time to ensure these connections are solid enought to build on."
nav_blending_of_iberian_identities:0 "Edicts of Acceptance"
nav_blending_of_iberian_identities_desc:0 "If Castilians and Leonese people can accept the Basque people into the Iberian fold, there isn't any reason why they wouldn't be able to accept others into the fold as well. The Basque language alone is enough to put off many people as it is radically different to any language around it, but seeing as it is a key facet of Spanish culture as a whole, perhaps people are becoming more accepting as time goes on."
nav_importing_ideas:0 "Import Foreign Ideas"
nav_importing_ideas_desc:0 "Foreigners can be met with suspicion in Spanish lands, but they shouldn't be put off forever. As time goes on, we'll foster a more diplomatically open and cordial attitude in the Spanish people. Even though they might be staunchly Catholic in their ways, culturally they can be accepting, and foreign ideas should not be much of an issue if the ideas can indeed be a benefit to our society as a whole."

and_the_most_fertile_lands_in_iberia_desc:0 "Spain is full of productive craftsmen and workers, but they are scattered across the peninsula in their own communities producing for only themselves. It falls upon the most productive population in Spain's heartland, the Andalusians, to start producing goods and services for the rest of the peninsula so that they can be lifted up and encouraged to work with their fellow Spanish citizens no matter where they come from. From religious structures to workshops to fortifications, Spain will be unified in what it produces."

and_expansion_of_andalusian_sailors_desc:0 "The northern people of Spain are suited to the hills and mountains, barely sailing compared to the likes of the eastern and western people of Spain, but the south? The Andalusian people are masters of sailing both inside the Mediterranean Sea and in the vast open ocean. Very few people can boast such naval prowess and even fewer are willing to show off such skills for either commerce or combat. Let us show our rivals and friends how to master both naval realms."
and_all_encompassing_court:0 "Foreign Talent in Abundance"
and_all_encompassing_court_desc:0 "Spain is nothing without its commercial and diplomatic connections and we know this very well; our connections across Europe are plentiful and our contacts outside of Europe are slowly increasing with time. The productive and lucrative ports that are in the southern part of Iberia are hubs for foreign intellectuals to gather at, meaning we can recruit any number of engineers, military thinkers, or philosophers that wish to stop by our realm."

Though some would overlook our humble diocese as nothing more than a place of Bavarians and Austrians gathering to worship, many know the great reputation Passau has from its past alongside its greatly rebuilt monasteries.

Our smiths stamp the blades with the glorious Passau wolf, a simplified rendering of our coat-of-arms that ensures that all know exactly where the blade has come from.

From east to west and north to south, princes and bishops turn on each other so that one religious side may triumph claim that they have the truest interpretation of the Bible, its theology, and the doctrines of faith itself.

There are also others who think noble blood stands out and should be enthroned to Passau's highest position, but we care not for these trivial aspects. What we need to focus on is where our candidate comes from. If they come from a Bavarian family, an Austrian family, a Bohemian family, or perhaps some other family in general, they will grant us certain advantages when it comes to relations with those around us."

The Diocese of Vienna will not stand forever, and we of Passau will be dedicated to retaking what power was taken from us.

This commission assessed the land and divided it up as best they could but perhaps the most stand-out aspect of this commission's work was the creation 12 secular baronies.

In this respect, the baronies of our land can construct castles and hand out capital punishment as they see fit whilst also serving the prince in the field and garrison for portions of the year. Alongside this, women could inherit fiefs inside of Achaea due to the laws not being entirely based upon Salic Law, thus offering a slightly wider array of people available to our court."

Achaea itself has had to adapt to these prospects over the decades through constructing new castles, allying certain states, or purely learning to fight with more heart and more discipline. It is this last aspect that we must cultivate most of all though since we are in such a precarious position, for if we cannot rely on proper defenses or worthy allies, we must defend the land with our bodies and weapons alone."

It has a large amount of authority in Achaea and its decisions are binding not only to the people below the prince, but also to the prince himself. On top of this Grand Court, the Assizes of Romania were produced between the 1200s and 1400s whilst our principality was still alive and well despite dynastic claims hampering things. The Assizes of Romania helped blend Byzantine laws with French law and has helped Achaea and other Greek polities achieve a modicum stability with regards to laws of the land."

Not only was he a prince who desired land and rightfully obtained it through the conquest of the rest of the Peloponnese, he was a poet and a troubadour who achieved a flourishing literary culture within the court of Achaea itself. Though he became embroiled in the politics of the Byzantines and the other small states around in the 1200s, his legacy lives on within us and it is our duty to carry on his legacy of both a vibrant court and a grand vision of conquest combined with literacy."

We may have been fated to die a sorrowful death back then, but we are much stronger now compared to back then and we can capitalize on these dynastic feuds in this current age as opposed to how futile we were when various dynasties from across Europe sought out our land through inheritance or conquest."

Such a valuable capture in battle led to the southern part of the Peloponnese being surrendered to the Byzantines and thus, it became the heart of the Despotate of Morea. Born in fire and bloodshed, Morea's regiments of fine soldiers and cavalry know all too well that what they fight for is the livelihood of the despotate and potentially all that graciously Greek in this world."

Morea must take the Hexamilion Wall as an example of what kind of fortifications it can and should build, ones that last a long time and that can be improved upon as time goes on whilst also being stationed at key strategic points so that our enemies will have the hardest time possible besieging them."

Over where we are, Morea is perhaps the prime beneficiary of Venice's outward influence since Venetian merchants do good business with Morean traders instead of Muslim traders to the north and east. Through these Venetian merchants, we will learn to refine our own trade practices and become a Greek entrepot."

Whether we build dirt or paved roads or try set up various stations to facilitate communication between them, Morea needs them to be able to relay messages across the land so that a more effective resistance to enemy forces may be coordinated.

Thus, the capital of the Patriarchate moved to Cividale, then to Udine, and then finally to Friuli where a bustling and robust city began to grow.

kingdom_of_candia_desc:0 "Under the rule of the Venetians, our land was known as the 'Kingdom of Candia' and was a staging ground for projecting Venetian influence outward toward the Aegean Sea. Though those days of Venetian dominance are gone, we still remember how strong of a naval presence they had around our island through both their fleets for combat and their fleets for trade. Crete should thoroughly aspire to be like Venice in this sense so that it too can project its naval presence outward."
memory_of_the_revolt_of_st_titus:0 "The Revolt of St. Titus and More"
memory_of_the_revolt_of_st_titus_desc:0 "The Venetian authority over Crete was not concrete and uniform in the past; Cretan people have had a long history of revolting against Venetian authority to assert the autonomy of Crete as a whole. Perhaps the largest revolt of these was the Revoly of St. Titus that happened from 1363 to 1368. Though the efforts of the rebels were not realized as Venice regained control eventually, they strived to create the 'Republic of Saint Titus' for all of Crete, an idea which has lasted to this very day. In memory and in the honor of those fellow Cretans that have fallen in battle to sustain Cretan autonomy, we carry forth in our righteous journey."
exposure_to_foreign_innovations:0 "Exposed to Foreign Ideas"
exposure_to_foreign_innovations_desc:0 "Venice was not completely bad in what it did for Crete and its people, we must admit that. In their time ruling over us, they exposed the Cretan people to a number of innovations and ideas that had their start in the various cities of the Italian Peninsula. This spreading of ideas and technologies must be cultivated if Crete is to proceed on as true state of its own, for learning about what others have come up with and integrating it into Crete itself is vital for staying afloat on the political scene."

natural_defenses_of_crete_desc:0 "Our island is not the most welcoming place for invaders to land on, no? Hills and rugged terrain all across the island make invading our homeland something of a Herculean task since not only do we have the terrain to back us up, we also have partisans from all across Crete ready to do battle with enemy invaders. The defensive nature of Crete will make invaders say to themselves, 'Even the hills have weapons?!' and we will laugh as we beat them back again and again."

genoese_and_venetian_naval_legacy_desc:0 "Genoa and Venice fought for quite a long time for influence on Crete in the past, and even though Venice won out in the end, we still have a distinct maritime legacy in us that stems from both. In order for Crete to hold its own in wars across the Mediterranean Sea, it needs to have a stronger navy with more sailors at the ready; building docks and shipyards across Crete's coastline is the first step in this process."

hostile_to_foreign_intruders_desc:0 "Cretans are nothing if not resourceful when it comes to devising a defensive strategy; even our peasants know how to defend their local areas with anything from crossbows and swords to outdated gunpowder weapons. Not only this, but working in tandem with the rugged terrain makes it so that fortificatiokns built from stone are less needed. Cretan fortifications though, are some of the best ones across Europe and this is largely due in part to partisans being able to supply and assist the garrisoned defenders."

The diplomatic landscape of Europe is unceasing in when and how it changes, thus Lippe needs to hold itself to the various deals it is promised over time so that it can still act accordingly.

Lippe, though somewhat divided on whether or not it desires to follow one path or another, is primed to adopt what is called a 'church ordinance' by some. Through this sort of religious constitution, we can uphold stability and peace internally throughout Lippe, at least for the time being."

It may be relatively new in comparison to others across Europe, but that does not mean it can't be a place for innovative work.

Some Malay people are here, folks from Java have settled in places, and there are even some small communities of Bugi and Batak people spread throughout.

Iban Dayaks live closest to the coasts, as one might expect, whilst the Bidayuh Dayaks live in the dense tropics of our mainland. The former take care of fishing, the latter take care of farming, yet both seem to have consistent feuds that make Sambas a rather volatile state at times. If we can work to connect the sea and land Dayaks closer together both culturally and economically, governing them will be easier for all of Sambas."

primogeniture_within_the_monarchy_desc:0 "Sambas is developing at a nice pace with communities seeing the rise of structures like tax offices, workshops, and small centers of learning. This development is helped by the fact that our administration and royal family are keen on keeping the traditional Dayak form of hierarchy in play with males taking priority over females for succession purposes. But, women are not cut out of every facet of power; Dayaks and throughout the rest of Sambas, both men and women can obtain property ownership and jostle for communal influence in that way."

In doing this, they are bringing with them their religion and their traditions which are tough to handle on their own, but what we really benefit from is the expansion in trade value for Sambas. The more we trade with the Malay people it seems, the more we profit in the form of money and capable sailors."

Though Kaharingan is seen as a form of Hinduism by outsiders, to us it is a very core part of the people of Sambas as a whole; Islam's influence across those who follow Kaharingan is noticeable in that it is melding with these traditions in a variety of ways. If we can stoke this intermingling of ideas instead of potential religious conflict, Sambas might be able to have Islam and Kaharingan live side-by-side in peace."

Especially in the tight mountain passes where armies may encounter each other more suddenly, the kukri has become a tool that both experienced and new soldiers trust to get them through close quarters combat.

linked_to_kuamon_desc:0 "After the Katyuri Dynasty of ages past fell, Kumaon rose up in prominence and has held sway around this area for many generations. Though their power is waning somewhat, we cannot deny our links both culturally and politically to Kumaon; embracing this link to them could perhaps grant us an easier time taking what land they of Kumaon have claims to."

seven_children_of_the_katyuri_kingdom_desc:0 "Once the old Katyuri Dynasty fell from grace, there were eight princely states that were left in the ashes: Kumaon, Doti, Baijnath-Katuri, Dwarahat, Baramandal, Askot, Sira, Sora, and Kali Kumaon. As things progressed, Doti and Kumaon remained as the only two serious forces that could live up to the legacy of the past and it is this claim to the old throne of the Katyuri Dynasty that we are known for. There is respect to be had for living within the bounds of this legacy, that much is certain."

The rulers of Kumaon have proven time and again that they cannot handle the chains of power effectively and that their subjects run wild without proper orders. Soon enough we will have our chance at showing Kumaon and others just how much we can live up the legacy of the Katyuri Dynasty, we just have to bide our time."

As geography would have it, the Kali and Karnali Rivers are just such two rivers that feed the heart of our state and its capital, meaning that if we are focused enough, we can certainly make these mountains and highlands bloom with crops and productivity."

They have their own distinct flavor thanks to being conducted in the mountains for so long, but they are still festivals that solidify our foundation amongst the people.

That is why we (and many others) have learned to skirmish with smaller numbers of troops so that there is less of a concern about supply routes and armies being too big to coordinate effectively."

Whilst we of Jumla are far from being true Rajput warriors and nobles, we can emulate some of their martial prowess by emphasizing stricter training methods and a more well educated set of commanders.

There are still some around to this day, Jumla being one of them, but that collapse into decentralized unrest and disorder instilled harsh lessons into the ruling family of Jumla.

Jumla needs the ruler to be ready and able to lead from the front with the men of the army! It is dangerous, true, but it is also inspiring to see that the one who rules Jumla is ready and willing to suffer the ravages of battle alongside a mere recruit or officer."

Now that writing and printing are becoming more of a realiy all around us, it is time that we make those teachings from past generations put into solid manuscripts and tomes ready for future generations to learn from and critique.

Yet the Tharu people have been seemingly gifted with an inherent gift: resistance to malaria! It is not in every single Tharu person, yes, but many people of Tharu descent are noticeably resistant to this terrible disease that plagues our region and nearby ones. It is through this resistance that we can better cultivate a stronger state for the Tharu people."

Thus, we are and have been seen as people of the forest for a great many generations now, practicing farming, hunting, and gathering to a much greater degree than our mountainous cousins.

This elected governance at the local level helps keep the balance of power in check and would greatly help us in extending our reach to more local communities where we need to collect taxes and recruits from, so why not try to implement across our nation?"

Though much has changed since the time of the Licchavis (such as their architecture being destroyed by earthquakes), we find ourselves still in need of these barracks at the edge of our city to provide us with a sense of security and militancy. Rebuilding them for our people and for our own protection will undoubtedly help spur more people to join up into the ranks of Kathmandu's military."

contacts_with_tibetan_buddhism_desc:0 "In the past, Kathmandu was a major trade hub and transit site between the Indian subcontinent and Tibet as a whole, so much so that Bhrikuti (from our region) married the Tibetan monarch named Songtsan Gampo. This marriage from back then helped bring Tibetan Buddhism into our region of the Himalayas, promoting religious dialogue and the diffusion of cultural and religious traditions throughout all regions nearby Kathmandu. Perhaps it is time we reach out to the Tibetan people? Perhaps it is time that Kathmandu becomes another trade hub and center of diffusion of cultural ideas."

Earthquakes are known to cause great destruction across our region and Kathmandu has felt the wrath of them in full, especially when a large earthquake destroyed much of the architecture from the Licchavi era, thus forcing the people to rebuild in the midst of terrible hardship. These experiences have hardened those Kathmandu and made its inhabitants ready for whatever nature may through at it; you can knock its people down to the ground, but you will never keep them down."

This connection to Buddhism, albeit not the strongest one there could be, should be revived and looked into throughout Makwanpur, for the theological and philosophical dialogue that could be had would certainly give innovative life to our land."

All of this is part of the 'sorting process' our region must go through in order to see which state is capable of rising to the challenge.

Yet all of this has brought more and more life into Makwanpur as we can and have been learning how to deal with these issues as they wash over our state.

The growing tensions with rival schools in Tibetan lands has led to a plethora of so-called Red Hat Sect members (otherwise known as followers of the Kagyu School) fleeing to Bhutan, meaning our religious politics are being colored greatly by the Kagyu School itself. Most important among these that our people and administration have embraced over the generations is the 'Drukpa Kagyu' subsect, and it is a subsect that can truly embody Bhutan as a whole."

Bhutan needs not the guidance from an authority in Lhasa or in the Kham region, no, Bhutan will be led by a true Zhabdrung ('At Whose Feet One Submits')!

This cannot be allowed to continue if we are to become a cohesive state that can protect itself from outsiders, no, we must curtail Morang's growing power and centralize power in the capital as time goes on.

We must take measures to expel these foreign elements in Gorkha before they get out of hand and before they begin to turn out own people against us."

founded_on_a_defensive_pretext_desc:0 "When our island was being invaded to the north in the late 1300s, Minister Alakesvara of the Kingdom of Gampola founded a fortress in the south to serve as a base of power and defense. As Gampola faded into history though, the fortress became a serious broker of power and influence in the region, giving rise to what we today know as Kotte. In this defensive environment that we were founded in, we must always be ready for when northern incursions start again and try to strike southward; we must give them no quarter and resist at all times!"

Ties to the Vijayanagara Empire have meant that Jaffna can grow mostly unhindered, but that isn't the case forever.

arab_and_european_style_firearms_desc:0 "Kotte has seen trade deals from places such as Sumatra, East Africa, and even Arabia, but this should not be a shock to anyone. Even firearms from Arab traders have made their way to the lands of Kotte in small numbers, and with European traders arriving slowly for trade deals in the region, they too bring their firearms to Kotte for trade deals. Utilizing these wonderful gifts from afar will certainly help Kotte safeguard Kotte's place in the region despite how few of them continue to work in these humid conditions."

ensure_the_royal_family_desc:0 "If there is one thing about the royal family in Kotte, it is that it is susceptible to hostile intrigue and unfit heirs. In order to rectify this so that Kotte can have a stronger authority over the land as a whole without worry, there should be a system of checks on what the heir should know by certain ages, which means they will be needing an actual education within Kotte. Not only this though, but regularly keeping an eye out for disloyalty in the family itself will help keep it safe since any disloyal members can and will be disowned, denounced, and if possible, tried for their crimes."

It is a tropical mess if one does not know the lay of the land, and on top of the tropical environment there are plenty of marshes across the entire island including near our capital fortress, meaning that should any invader attempt to subjugate Kotte through brute force, they will be met with an uphill battle unlike anything they have ever faced."

But it won't end there, there are still many claimants around and there is always the threat from across the water as Hindu commanders and ministers would love to see this island become their own.

We can and will strike back for our heartland no matter who holds it as our connections throughout the entire island are far more numerous than anyone can imagine.

Enforcing laws is becoming steadily easier and communicating with towns far from the capital is becoming less and less stressful."

Defending the heart of Kandy (that is the inner most parts of the island) through the usage of natural defenses, partisan attacks, and even set traps will help deter any and all invaders from coming to our land.

Generations of politics, religious shifts, and diplomatic moves has left Kutai and its nearby lands (like Berau) in a state of flux, but it is through this state of flux that we learn the most, incorporating the best practices from Kutai into our own and attempting to discard what practices do not work on a practical level."

The masterful sailors and the simplistic yet verstile boats they use are perfect for trade and warfare alike, which is why they have become much more common around our own waters. Berau taking up these practices with regards to shipbuilding and sailing is only natural as looking out to the seas and controlling them through a large, skilled fleet is exactly what we need if we are to survive and thrive."

Learning how to manage a somewhat more decentalized system of governance whilst we slowly make progress toward cultivating the land in a way that allows clear paths and eventually sturdy roads is going to be necessary if Berau is to survive."

Berau is one of those places left behind and we are only now able to put those old lessons to use via extending our range of trade links and through mastering our own trade routes. The Majapahit Empire opened up a great deal of trade routes near and far from Berau, and now it is time that we take our cut of each one."

Berau can easily become one of those targets, can it not? Our ports are growing and the people of our land are thriving, ensuring that attention is drawn to our land over time, but we must also be prepared to defend these incoming riches from pirates and privateers alike.

So crucial are these places that prosperity in this general region might never have come about if these places were not around, which is exactly why we must continue to build up Basra well into the future.

Yes tribal feuds and cultural clashes often occur because of our geographic position, but we would be wrong to say that we are not cultivating some sort of success within our own people.

If we can set up a series of grain reserves, put efforts into making sick camps and soup kitchens, and possibly even build up a suitable navy so that Basra does not have to fear blockades, then maybe we can overcome this final natural hurdle."

It is not a truly centralized state under a monarch that rules through clearly defined channels across a vast set of domains, but rather it is more so a system of communities both large and small working together toward with a large administrative body of sorts that governs all. Whoever leads the barangay is by no means the center of all things within the barangay itself, for they are inherently reliant on various community leaders and noble families to get anything done.

Extracting water and food to settle new villages over time isn't easy, but new agricultural methods combined with our more autonomous system of governance has allowed us gain more and more population as time has gone on, a population that is dedicated to keeping Ait Abbas safe from harm."

village_republics_of_the_plains_desc:0 "Authority over this portion of the Maghreb that we call home used to be ruled by the Hafsids of Tunis, but their slipping authority has led to villages of our own people, the Kabyle, to their own local politics. We of Ait Abbas know just how crucial these autonomous 'village republics' are for our people to survive. They utilize local councils called 'tajamaat' to settle matters and maintain relations within and outside of their own communities, meaning they have and still do keep mercantile connections intact whilst also vehemently defending their way of life from any invaders."

muslim_and_christian_refugees_bring_wealth_desc:0 "There have been several instances of Muslims and Christians interacting in our part of the Maghreb because of how important the coast nearby is to trade and influence; if one can control the interior too, the coast becomes a stronger base of power for whoever holds it. Such meetings of Christians and Muslims though has led to refugees fleeing to the interior where we hold power, and who are we to turn away these renegades and refugees? They might be outlaws, but they also know exactly what markets need what resources from us."

structured_villages_and_gunpowder_defenses_desc:0 "Ait Abbas as a state is not just embodied by the Kalaa of Ait Abbas, for our architectural prowess and engineering endeavors are slowly bearing fruit in villages outside of our capital. Houses with two stories, balconies, paved streets, and even housing made of stone with tiled flooring, all of this and more is what we see on the inside of our settlements. And facing outward are strong, sturdy walls with gunpowder weapons at the ready and a garrison capable of holding out to the very last man or woman."

investing_in_arts_and_weapons_desc:0 "The expanding trade networks around Ait Abbas as well as the growing desire of foreigners wanting luxury goods means that our people are producing beautiful things not just for themselves or others in Ait Abbas, but for other towns and cities entirely. From Iberia to Anatolia and from Rome to Baghdad, the products of our workers is growing in quantity and quality at the same time. If you need muskets, clothes, carpets, or tools, be sure to buy it from us!"

intellectual_life_away_from_the_coast_desc:0 "Most of our core Kabyle culture is oral in nature, but over time we have had a growing number of zaouia/zawiya spreading through our land which are home to Islamic scholars and those studying Islam in general. Not only this, but we have an increasing number of people who can read and write thanks to the refugees that have settled down and also the Islamic scholars that are not shy about sharing their ideas in written form. Such varied traditions and cultures can all be blended together in our land over time, we just need to keep tending to the gentle flames of knowledge and belief over time."

united_somali_communites_desc:0 "The various Somali communities and towns that are spread across the Horn of Africa have been fractured in the past, swearing loyalty to different leaders so that one day they would see unification. It was a turbulent path to unity but out of the fires of war and through firm diplomacy, Somali people can finally say with confidence that they are united behind one flag and one state, ready to defend it no matter the cost."

dominant_merchant_fleets_desc:0 "Somali people have made their living off of trade for centuries thanks to the great coastal cities that provide safe places for merchant vessels. Guarding these waters against attacking raiders and such is also part of what earns Somali people prosperity and a good reputation, and it is because of this protective attitude toward our coasts and trade routes that we have amassed such a magnificent fleet."

formal_clan_duties_desc:0 "The various clans of Somalia are diverse in their origins and they pose a possible threat to our power if they become dissatisfied with our authority. By structuring the government of Somalia in such a way that it gives each formal clan a workable position in Somalia, we can lessen the threat they pose and increase the amount of resources they give to us, the most important one being men capable of fighting."

We desire wealth and prosperity through trade, thus we lacked the ambition to formulate a proper military on land that could at least defend Somali communities effectively. It is now that we will turn this around and begin instituting strong reforms to the Somali soldiers aimed at instilling discipline in them. It will take a long time to achieve our goals for our military, but laying a solid foundation here and now will go a long way in Somalia's future."

Though this title was normally used to denote a subject state of Byzantium, the lack of power projected forth by the ruinous Byzantium meant that Stefan was able to rule on his own, making deals and decisions on his own for the good of all of Serbia.

Heavy cavalry with scale or plate armor is quickly becoming obsolete whilst mobility and quick strikes are becoming more and more advantageous for armies all around the Balkans. We will go along with this move to light cavalry and begin setting up our regiments of so-called 'hussars' for future battles."

libraries_and_development_of_serbia_desc:0 "The development of Serbia as an independent bastion of Orthodox Christianity with a distinct South Slavic twist has been hampered by warfare to our south, political dealings in every direction, and attempts to expand Serbian power outward instead of consolidating power inwards. It is time that we look toward our cities like Belgrade and Novo Brdo and develop them with both libraries and schools so that our people can look to a brighter future in their own land."

silver_mines_of_serbia_desc:0 "Silver mines in Serbia are some of the most prized parts of the land and we must work to keep them both productive and safe.

serbian_vlasts:0 "The Vlasts of Serbia"
serbian_vlasts_desc:0 "Dividing our territory into a series of districts is a bit controversial, but it's going to be needed if we are to manage Serbian lands effectively. The governors of these vlasts will of course pay fealty to the Serbian despot and through their administrative divisions, uphold certain civilian and minor military duties, thus helping project our central authority over a larger distance."

hadjuk_irregulars_desc:0 "In the rural areas near the edge of Serbian borders and in places where Serbian communities are governed by a foreign power, an irregular kind of infantry is showing up time and time again. We aren't sure how the term 'Hajduk' came about, but this term for these irregular fighters is what most state call them. If we of Serbia can hire them or even integrate various Hadjuks into our military and also look into their fighting styles for our own benefit, the entirety of our military will surely become better in terms of quality and quantity."

Not only this, but Tuareg people have also settled in various cities in the north and south, making our connections even wider than others might initially think. Perhaps in places like Timbuktu, Tunis, Oran, and Bornu we will see our influence increase as time goes on."

masters_of_the_sahara_desc:0 "We are indeed the undisputed masters of the Sahara and this is known by many states on the northern side and southern side. We know just how to navigate the cruel sands, how to use camels to their greatest extent, and how to conduct warfare throughout the merciless sands that fill up the barrier between North Africa and West Africa. If any wish to challenge us in our domain or elsewhere, we will use what skills we have against them."
unify_tuareg_amenokals:0 "Unite the Amenokals"
unify_tuareg_amenokals_desc:0 "The most paramount of chiefs in Tuareg communities is called the Amenokal, and they usually lead large confederations of Tuareg people in general. Though we are slowly changing from this traditional style of ruling over own people, the amenokals are still vital to our power and we continue to respect them in day-to-day activities, though those that swear fealty to us will need to compromise on some matters concerning governance."

civil_servant_slavery_desc:0 "The Ikelan (meaning 'to be black') are a distinct slave class in Tuareg society and they sometimes live in their own separate communities from the main Tuareg community, though even then they act as civil servants and such. Acquired through raiding various states in West Africa and also through various states subject to Tuareg authority, these slaves acting as civil servants of sorts will do well in maintaining the growing economy of the Agadez Sultanate."
reexamine_tuareg_hierarchy:0 "Reexamine Tuareg Hierarchy"
reexamine_tuareg_hierarchy_desc:0 "For centuries the hierarchy of the Tuareg people has been unchanged due to the relatively stable nature of trade across the Sahara and the nature of cyclical politics in West Africa. But as things are changing and new concepts on society and administration are making their way into our state, we are increasingly being asked by our people to reform the old Tuareg societal hierarchy. It would take time and effort and perhaps disrupt some internal relations, but perhaps this path of reformation could be for the best if we are to sustain a lasting state for the Tuareg people."

indirect_warfare_of_sokoto_desc:0 "The forests, savannah, and dry deserts of West Africa make for an interesting landscape to fight in and the Fulani people know this for a fact. For centuries they've been more pastoral and nomadic in their ways, but since Sokoto has come about there are thousands upon thousands of Fulani people settling down in cities and taking up actual gunpowder weapons to fight with. Thus, we are learning to utilize the landscapes we've lived in for centuries with these new weapons of war."
slave_empire_of_west_africa:0 "Slave Empire of West Africa"
slave_empire_of_west_africa_desc:0 "The distinction between a slave and a regular person in Sokoto is different when compared to how the fiendish Europeans conduct slavery. In Sokoto and indeed in many other West African states that came before Sokoto, slavery is and was common and involved working plantations and working in the military with at least better conditions than those offered by Europeans, but still they could be sold and traded around. Being that Sokoto is as powerful as it is, the trade of slaves is going to continue in West Africa for now."

Still, some practices, such as the concept of a dzong, are prevalent throughout Tibetan communities. For the dzong in particular, it is said that in the construction of a house it is in a sense making it like a castle to protect from malevolent forces outside of it. Various rituals and practices from the Bon faith go along with this of course and it helps serve to keep our people very vigilant and protective."

The traditions of the Nyingma school are usually passed on via loose oral networks of its practitioners and it is because of how loose it can be that others outside of our main faith can find solace in it.

The Karma Kagyu school, Drikung Kagyu school, Taklung Kagyu school, Shangpa Kagyu school, and the Drukpa Lineage are all children of the Kagyu tradition and with their favor and assistance in both civil and military matters, Tibet will be all the more powerful and unified."

the_sakya_school_desc:0 "The 'pale earth' school comes from the second period of translation of Buddhist scripture from Sanskrit into the Tibetan language in the late 1000s and was firmly established by the 'Great Sakyapa', Sachen Kunga Nyingpo. The Sakya school has a historical foundation of authority over various people unlike what others might think at first glance since, the Sakya lamas were given authority from the Yuan Dynasty to govern over Tibetan land as a vassal state of sorts. We would do good to utilize the governing capability of the Sakya religious officials as Tibet gains more ground in the world."

He founded the Ganden Monastery where the Ganden Tripa is the spiritual leader of the entirey school itself, but the most influential political figure that also holds religious significance has undoubtedly been the Dalai Lama. The Gelug school stresses a variety of matters just as all schools of thought do, but the Gelug school emphasizes vinaya (monastic discipline) more so than others, and it is this disciplined attitude that we will cultivate in our hearts and minds, both in times of peace and in times of war."

The Pagan Kingdom attempted to round up the Shan states into a confederacy of sorts, but it barely held together for more than a few decades before falling apart.

The prosperity they kept in Greek islands as well as Greek mainland towns is what we are striving to keep alive and well. This in turn is leading us to promote a more expansive navy and a wider range of potential trade partners."

protect_byzantine_arts_desc:0 "It was during the 10th century to approximately the time of the Fourth Crusade in 1204 that the revival of Byzantine art occurred in the lands of Greece. Mainland Greece certainly benefited from this revival since it was endowed with many great churches and cathedrals, but we must not rest yet! These sacred and beautiful places are always in danger of being raided and destroyed by invaders and thus we must protect what gives us lasting prestige and beauty."
greek_resistance:0 "Greek Resistance"
greek_resistance_desc:0 "When the Turkish forces came in from the east, many Greeks did not simply bow down to their onslaught and conquering emirs and pashas. They stayed reserved and hidden away, selectively peaking out to struggle against the Turkish forces so that they were not completely decimated. This resistant Greek spirit lives on without end to this very day no matter who the invader is or where they come from."

diaspora_of_greek_people_desc:0 "The Turks not only conquered our territory, but they also helped make for a great exodus of Greek people from the mainland. Toward the rest of Europe did they head off to, serving in other courts around Europe in the hopes that one day they may return home and serve a truly Greek state. That time has now come and as they arrive back, our good name will spread around the likes of Europe without failure."

lifted_from_the_ground_up_desc:0 "As Turkish authority tightened on Greeks, the rules also tightened in certain areas, leading to Greeks becoming impoverished and left to worse conditions than how they were after the Fourth Crusade. Now that we can sustain ourselves and function properly, the Greek people will come back up from the depths of poverty and rise back to the urban cities that they once knew. Coastal trade centers will come back to life and our once grand cities will know splendor like never before."

Try as they might to spread it thin or shift it from the great cities of Athens, Sparta, Thessaly, and many others, these foreign occupants have done nothing but further contribute to the enduring legacy and heritage of the Greek people. We are without perfection, that much is certain, but we are not without the greatest living spirit in all of Europe."

reestablish_the_bishoprics_desc:0 "In the time of the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries, the old bishoprics of Galicia were not just religious authorities that Galicia communities looked up to, but they were also political players that meddled in matters of governance normally reserved for dukes and kings; some bishoprics were even seen as warlords since they could wield the weapons of levied armies in opposition to others around them. Reviving these old bishoprics could be very beneficial to Galicia as a whole, but we will need to keep a very tight leash on them so that they do not destabilize the state as a whole."

Many simply see Castile, Aragon, and Portugal as the crowned powers that shall hold Iberia in its entirety, but Galicians are not bound to this destiny by any means. The chains imposed by the crown of Castile and the subsequent power grabs by all three aforementioned powers will not stay for long, for Galicia will take to the sword and musket to break free. Iberia will not stay silent, it will be contested for!"

Though the city is not as grand as say, Toledo or Barcelona, it still has great potential for economic growth and urbanization. Promoting its regal status from before and funding new infrastructure projects that can turn the communtiies within into functioning and profitable sectors will help bring not only the area around Santiago de Compostela into greatness, but Galicia as a whole."

It would be beneficial to Galicia to paint them in a more heroic light so that those troops that we levy and train from rural communities are more inspired to fight for Galicia. We certainly do not want a second set of Irmandino Revolts, but we also must learn to harness the tenacity and will that those once brave fighters had in themselves."

The lands of Scandinavia have been disunited for several decades before our time, but we must have the strength and the will to see to it that the region is united! The Danish people already look to its royal administration with great pride, it is time that we ensure that pride stays in their hearts and minds."

danish_economic_overhaul_desc:0 "The way we have done finances up until now has been rather disorganized and fairly decentralized; some say it is why Denmark has been unable to project its power outward like it was once able to in the times of Cnut the Great. These ways of decentralized finances must be done away with! An economic overhaul internally in the administration and in the naval sector (since the latter is a large part of our expenses) is necessary so that our treasury and our salaries are dealt with on equal ground by educated and skilled workers."

Trade posts and conquered territory alike, the Danish will obtain what it once lost so long ago and soon, all of the northern lands will see just how powerful we are.

the_question_to_us_christians_desc:0 "Faith has been key to the people of Denmark for a very long time, but so as the dissatisfaction with the Catholic Church itself. We must ask ourselves harrowing questions on what path we will choose as the Protestant Reformation goes forth: What teachings will guide us? What theology is even remotely correct? What will the political outcome be if choose a certain faith over another? Whatever we choose amidst the fire and smoke, the Danish people will surely be happy with it."

To supply our armies and to ensure that we always have the larger military force at the ready, we need to institute a new system called the 'corvee system'.

restoration_of_the_past:0 "A New Age of Ilkhans"
restoration_of_the_past_desc:0 "Founded by Hulagu Khan, son of Tolui and grandson of Ghengis Khan, in 1256, the Ilkhanate ruled much of what was the southwestern portion of the once grand Mongol Empire. It was an empire that held tenuous power over the region of Persia and neighboring areas to the west and north, but its power was great enough to continuously challenge the Mamluk Sultanate for control of the Levant. Still, the Ilkhans were subordinate to the Great Khan of the east situated at the head of the Yuan Dynasty, but this is no longer the case. Our leader is no longer subservient to a far away khan, but rather leads the empire on his own accord."
internal_tolerance:0 "Promote Internal Tolerance"
internal_tolerance_desc:0 "From Hulagu to Baydu, the Ilkhans were relatively indifferent to religions though they kept Buddhism around in Persian lands for quite some time despite the region being majority Islamic in essence. It was not until Baydu's overthrowing by Ghazan that Islam was adopted as the official faith of the Ilkhanate in 1295 (after a majority of Mongol emirs had already converted to Islam), though it was not until the death of the influential Mongol emir Nawruz that religious tolerance was achieved to a great degree. We would be wise to learn from Nawruz's failures and flaws and work to consistently improve upon our religious tolerance."

improve_upon_past_science_inquiry_desc:0 "A great observatory in Maragheh was built by the early Ilkhans, though since then chaos has reigned throughout the region and as such scientific inquiry has been left to gather dust in a lonely corner. With our establishment of power in the region and the coming about of the Ilkhanate once more, we could easily patronize and rework our inquiry into scientific matters since times of peace and stability will help keep great buildings like observatories and libraries intact and functional."
versed_mongolian_conquests:0 "Versed in Mongolian Conquests"
versed_mongolian_conquests_desc:0 "Though the Mongol Empire may be gone and fragmented beyond repair to many, what is not gone is the way the Mongol Empire conquered people and eased them into the fold of other conquered people. We would do well to learn and possibly refine this method of conquest as time goes on so that the Ilkhanate can continue to project its power in the future whilst also ensuring an easier path to peace for our realm."
ghazan_style_reform_edicts:0 "Inspiration from Mahmud Ghazan"
ghazan_style_reform_edicts_desc:0 "Mahmud Ghazan was not only the first Islamic Ilkhan, but he was also a very capable and well-meaning ruler. During his reign, he reformed Ilkhanid finances and fiscal policy (including unified measurements of coinage and weights), issued a new census for the empire, ordered the construction of new hospitals, hostels, schools, and posts for trade, and he also reformed the way in which edicts in the empire's administration were handled. Emulating this reform-minded nature of Ghazan is going to be hard to do, but to keep the Ilkhanate alive is to look to the future and actively engage with it, not to rely purely on the past."
zamburak_cavalry_arm:0 "Develop Zamburak Cavalry"
zamburak_cavalry_arm_desc:0 "Whilst holding the title of 'Ilkhan' is important as it lends legitimacy in our reign, it is important that we do not stay stagnant in military strategy like our ancestors may have. Persian lands make heavy and large cannons hard to carry around, so we must devise new ways of incorporating gunpowder weapons into our ranks. One innovative invention is what some call the 'Zamburak', literally meaning 'wasp', and it is a swivel-mounted small cannon mounted on the back of camels. Utilizing them in our military will greatly improve our effectiveness in future battles and can be seen as an evolution of our ancestors tactics."

reformed_yam_system_desc:0 "Much like how Mahmud Ghazan improved upon the Yam system in his time, we too will take to improving it in our time. Constructing more dedicated and central roads for messengers, merchants, civilians, and military personnel to travel on as well as building up new relay stations along the way for our people will ensure that the roads are efficient enough for us. Not only this, but we will employ people to maintain the roads over time so that they do not wither away into impassable patches of land."

order_of_the_dragon_desc:0 "Founded in 1408 by Sigismund von Luxembourg, King of Hungary at the time, the Order of the Dragon was a chivalric order founded whilst the crusaders were still ongoing. The initiates were required to defend the cross and fight the enemies of Christanity, especially the Ottoman Empire since they were the biggest threat back then. Though they are declining in importance as time goes on, their legacy gives our troops and military a zeal unlike those around us. Who is to say that the Order of the Dragon is ever truly dead?"

learning_from_debasing_coinage_desc:0 "Whilst Sigismund von Luxembourg was active in the defense of Hungary and its foreign policy, these activities and engagements required great amounts of money. They required so much money that Sigismund regularly debased currency to the point where Transylvanian peasants revolted in 1438. We need to learn to never step toward this path again, and to ensure that our monarch can handle financial matters in a just way that does not invoke rebellious sentiment."

The power he has is seen by some to be just, but many of the court know that it is a needless stumbling block that we have had to work around for a long time. It is time that we institute the 'Decretum Maius' and officially cut down the power of the palatine and instead strengthen county magistrates instead since they are the ones that work close with the lower classes of Hungary. This will help bolster our administrative capabilities far into the future."

frontier_settler_traditions_desc:0 "Cascadia's land is by no means easy to traverse the further you go toward the mountains. Settlers braved these uncharted trails and setup small villages that grew in size to upstart towns and cities, but these foundational times were also filled with dangers from wildlife and hostile natives. All Cascadians willing to settle the frontier will need to be versed in firearms and survival training, and we know that many will strive for this training since the frontier is a lucrative place for those daring enough to venture into it."
cascade_mountains:0 "The Cascade Mountains"
cascade_mountains_desc:0 "Tall and steep mountains mark the barrier between the western coast of these lands and the great interior plains where wide open tracts of land are roamed by a variety of people. Traversing the Cascade Mountains requires endurance, stamina, and keen senses, for an ambush from enemy forces could start a deadly skirmish in the perilous heights. Not only this, but surviving off what the land can provide is also needed when moving through the Cascade Mountain, which is why most of our soldiers are also capable hunters and survivalists."

Trading vessels from all across the Pacific Ocean and even from the Atlantic Ocean stop by in our friendly ports along the sides of the inlet, garnering us more trade revenue, so why not impose some trade taxes and such?

Now that we are free from the greedy hands of our former overlords, we can work on governing Cascadia for Cascadians solely.

Indeed the allure of wealth from gold has brought many to Sonora and made them stay indefinitely, but we are much smarter than our former overlords who once governed over us, for we are not just going to let the gold miners run our economics into the ground through inflation. Instead, we will take a firm economic approach that is intent on mitigating inflation as much as possible."

Getting up close and personal is something we do not want to do."

Grenades, weapons that are larger than muskets but smaller than cannons, even cannons that seem almost too big to even be fired properly, all of this will be utilized and tried out by the Ottoman military. Only the best designs will survive the test of time and this strive for gunpowder prowess will make our artillery outdo anything Europe or Asia can put forth."

Now that it has been under our control for a long while and our navy has been building up in a variety of ways, Karamursel will become the nucleus of our various fleet, allowing us to field a great amount of galleys and merchant ships that can take on the likes of Venice and Genoa."

As a sort of informal police force of sorts yet also an effective cavalry force, the Sipahi variable role in the Ottoman Empire means that we will need more of them as time goes on, especially as our empire continues to expand into new areas."

The piety in our rulers and the power we are gathering as time goes on should show all in the Islamic world that we, the Ottoman Empire, are the true protectors of Muslims from outside forces.

From politics to the economy itself, Junkers could very well be our downfall if they come under the influence of foreigners or if they become disobedient to our authority.

It is a slow and tiresome job for large nations, but Prussia is not like those others that want vast swaths of land across the whole of Europe. As we are content with a smaller portion of land, we can focus solely on modernizing Prussian military standards and the structures that go into forming the military itself, and after we do all of this, there will be none that can stand in our path."

Though much has changed since those founding days of 1138, we still retain memories of the days when medieval soldiers and frontier outposts were common sights in our land.

Perhaps the greatest known instance of this bloody factionalism is that of the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, with the former supporting the Pope and the latter supporting the Holy Roman Emperor. It is a conflict that we must learn from as the blood spilled by it still stains the history of Florence to this day; if something like it breaks out again, the republic may see never the end of it."

It really is a sight to behold, is it not? But the job of maintaining what has been cultivated for so many centuries is never quite done, for the republic can always be improved in some sort of way.

The banking sector is where a lot of this power comes from as our honest and smart bankers have taken it upon themselves to invest money, promote development, and choose wisely as to where they should stake their livelihood. Because of all of this, we can safely say: blessed are we of Tuscany who profit from these ambitions for good, and blessed will our adminsitration be should it ever need to rely on loans from internal lenders."

We must ensure that all, even bishops and priests, are subject to the laws of Venice so that corruption does not creep into our land whilst the court system is unable to do a thing about it.

The Venetian island of Murano is its traditional home and the glass and glass-like products produced in Murano are some of the most pristine items that are treasured by many.

Seeing as we need many of our own soldiers and peasants here in the mainland though, we should set up trading colonies instead so that we use less manpower in them and can more easily find profit within the land itself.

He had supremacy over the Scandinavian peninsula, lands that were held by the Wends at the time, and also all territory north of the Elbe River. He strived to increase the influence of his archbishopric as much as possible to have it reign as the supreme archdiocese in the far north, though he failed to see this ambition through.

Calling upon these insurgents again can ensure the safety of Mexico's independence in the future, and it can also help draw more support for our military if we ever need more than what we currently have."

what_legacy_does_mexico_have_desc:0 "The legacy that we of Mexico hold is shrouded in fog: is it a legacy of imperial conquest? Of upholding republican values? Is there perhaps a third alternative to these two paths? Whatever we find laying beyond the dense fog, we will ensure that Mexico's diverse array of people are represented well so that they can do here what they could not do under the authority of their former overlords in regards to instituting fair and just legislation."

dumbarton_castle_desc:0 "From as far back as our generations can remember, Dumbarton Castle has been the place where fates of lords and clan leaders have been decided since it is in such a pivotal position. With its name meaning roughly 'the fortress of the Britons', it and also being able to support a sizable naval fleet nearby, Dumbarton Castle will forever serve as an example of the fortitude and power of our land."

the_crux_of_fighting_for_three_sides_desc:0 "These islands to the north that we call home are all claimed by three groups of people besides ourselves: The Scots of the Highlands, the Irish, and the Norse from the far east. Over the centuries we have had claims on our land pressed so that certain individuals may succeed or fail in certain capacities, yet all of these claims just make things all the more clear for us: the history of these fair islands is nothing but old claims and being caught between larger powers. It is time we capitalize on all this bickering and schemeing and press what claims we have!"
clans_of_the_isles:0 "The Clans of the Isles"
clans_of_the_isles_desc:0 "Our land is the origin place of a fair few clans scattered throughout, from Clan MacDougall to Clan Ruaidhri. Whilst we cannot hope to rein in every single member of these clans back to our islands, we can use what connections we have with them to recruit strong and capable fighters for our military. Not only this, but we could also possibly enlist a fair few sailors out of these clans since we are situated in an area where knowing how to sail is vital to survival."

norse_blood_of_these_islands_desc:0 "Norse people are not entirely gone from our land but their numbers are slowly declining as a whole. Despite this, our blood is still intertwined with that of Norse folks who sailed to these islands and conuqered them for their own benefit centuries ago. Their mighty sailing capabilities and prowess on the high seas is what we should strive to emulate as we continue to build ourselves up."
refine_the_ounceland_system:0 "The Ounceland System Redone"
refine_the_ounceland_system_desc:0 "The traditional unit of land measurement in our region has been that of the Ounceland. It is based on the rent paid instead of actual land area and has been around for many generations, but we cannot help but start to identify flaws in the system that could be refined if we put enough effort into the matter. Perhaps we could extract more out of our land if we pass new legislation and attempt to come up with a new version of the ounceland system."
hardened_over_generations:0 "Consistent Hardship"
hardened_over_generations_desc:0 "It is without question that these islands that we call home have been subjected to hardship after hardship over the decades as many wars and conflicts have been fought over who owns what and what clans should be in charge of which islands. We bear the scars of these past conflicts in broad daylight, showing all around us that we will not be put down so easily and that we will endure until the very end."

listening_to_the_west_country_men_desc:0 "A variety of people from the West Country, that of the southwestern portion of mainland England, are looking to endorse and fund our expansionist efforts. Several noted admirals and advisors are willing to serve our interest both out on the high seas and in lands close to home, promoting the identity of Great Britain as a whole and propagating its power in the vast trade routes of Atlantic Ocean. Listening to the advice these people have to offer will only help us more in the future."

privateer_and_propagate_power_desc:0 "Whether it is through strict colonial organization or ensuring that taxes and tariffs are properly followed and collected, we must ensure that British influence spreads by any and all means. Sometimes it is through shady channels that some would find questionable, other times it is through proud and majestic endeavors, yet every single time we will strive to have our actions increase our reach in the world at large."
lessons_of_a_new_model_army:0 "Reformation of Military Principles"
lessons_of_a_new_model_army_desc:0 "The days of feudal levies and calling upon loyal nobles for service are declining; we are having to rely more and more on new ways of organizing our own military so that the empire is held together and defended properly. If we can begin to modernize our military and start up a system to professionalize those who choose to serve over time, we'll be able to keep up the pace with regards to military might. The French, Spanish, German princes, and even Italian states are sure to do this as well, meaning we will surely be evenly matched."
reformation_of_redcoat_regiments:0 "Redcoats, Stand Firm"
reformation_of_redcoat_regiments_desc:0 "The characteristic garb of our soldiers is increasingly becoming the red coats that they wear for service and ceremonies. Not only this, but the ever evolving military doctrines we are putting into place is giving our soldiers in red coats a distinct edge in battle since we have been open to embracing this new era of gunpowder weaponry. Making the red coats a standard in our regiments and ensuring they can flexibly follow instructions with muskets always at the ready will help bolster our overall military capability."

refitting_the_royal_navy_desc:0 "What is an empire like ours if it doesn't have a proper navy to protect its shores? We are an island nation after all! Royalty like us and our great empire needs a truly royal navy and we will outfit ours with the smartest and most capable sailors we can find, alongside the strongest ship designs we can muster. The many pieces of our domain will be protected no matter what sort of enemy seeks to intrude on our plans."
the_move_toward_abolitionism:0 "Enslaving Violates the Rights of Man"
the_move_toward_abolitionism_desc:0 "Though we have been engaged in it prior to today, the slave trade is increasingly becoming a tense issue inside our empire. The people of Great Britain, especially the scholars and advisors close to the heart of power, are raising questions as to how morally right it is to be enslaving people despite them being of a different skin color and of a different language. They are human too, are they not? They deserve rights like any other man, do they not? This notion of abolitionism isn't going to stop anytime soon in our empire, so perhaps it is time we fully look into the matter and make a just and righteous judgement."

Our rivals in Venice know of our glory as well and they have coveted it for decades just like we covet their glory, yet our time in the sun is far from over. Genoa must keep pressing forward with its dutiful and grand navy guiding the way; we, the 'la Dominant dei mari' (the Dominant of the Seas), 'la Superba' (the Superb one), and the 'la Repubblica dei magnifici' (the Republic of the Magnificents), will be the one that encompasses all of the Mediterannean!"
old_byzantine_trade_ties:0 "Byzantine Connections"
old_byzantine_trade_ties_desc:0 "Old connections from when the Byzantine Empire was still a grand power in the east are around, even though Turkish traders and merchants have taken the place of Byzantine ones. Genoa's influence in the Aegean Sea remains there even after all this time has passed, though it is on the cusp of falling into disarray if we cannot maintain a good fleet nor good income. If we can manage to cement our hold over Lesbos, Azov, and our other territories in the east, then we can capitalize off of what old Byzantine trade ties we have still."
providing_credit_to_others:0 "Credit where Credit is Needed"
providing_credit_to_others_desc:0 "As politics continue to rumble around in the Holy Roman Empire to our north, various princes, bishops, and sometimes even emperors need sources of credit and funds for their campaigns both in the political and military realm. We of Genoa are all too eager to offer credit in these circumstances since we can profit off of these deals later, we just have to remember to learn from when these credit deals turn sour so that we can improve our methods of financing."
genoese_banking:0 "Genoese Banking Endeavors"
genoese_banking_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the oldest banks in the world is found within Genoa, that which is called the Bank of Saint George. Founded in 1407 and still running now, it is a testament to our will to continue our banking prospects even as other states around us invest into banking as a whole. What makes us stand out in the respect is just how efficient our methods of banking are and how much fortune our noble families have amassed. These two aspects in tandem with each other gives Genoese banks the fuel they need to assess and evaluate economic matters in manner unmatched by anyone else, and it will help Genoa become one of the banking centers in Europe."
indirect_genoese_governance:0 "Indirect Authority"
indirect_genoese_governance_desc:0 "The nature of the Genoese state means that it does not have the power to govern its lands to the east and beyond Corsica in a direct manner. We have relied heavily on indirect governance methods for a long while and it has worked for us so far, but we are soon going to feel the strain that is keeping up with maintaining these far off lands underneath our decentralized way of governing. On the plus side, it does mean that Genoa can rule over more land as a whole as compared to other states around us."
venetian_conflicts:0 "The Eternal Sea Rivalry"
venetian_conflicts_desc:0 "Venice is undoubtedly our largest rival. Whether it is at foreign markets or along the shores of the Mediterannean Sea, the ships and merchants from Venice plague the power that stems from Genoa without end. We must not lose hope though, for we know that we can beat Venice eventually if we calculate our moves out and ally the right states against Venice. Our fleets will fit for any major clash at sea as well since we are actively learning from our defeats before and improving upon our naval tactics as the years go by."
the_genoese_arsenal:0 "An Arsenal for Genoa"
the_genoese_arsenal_desc:0 "The Venetian Arsenal is something we do not like to be jealous of, but we cannot help ourselves in this manner. It is famous for its ability to produce ships at an amazing rate, serving to prop up the Venetian fleet time and time again. Though we cannot have the arsenal directly, perhaps we can start building our own arsenal for Genoa and concentrate funds toward obtaining engineers and builders who know exactly what they are doing with regards to building ships for trade and war. If we eclipse Venice in the future, we might even be able to dismantle their arsenal and make ours the only one in all of Europe."
delegation_of_powers:0 "Delegate Central Authority"
delegation_of_powers_desc:0 "Our former overlords were far too fond of central authority and placing it in the hands of either one person or just a few highly valued people. We must delegate some of these powers once entrusted to monarchs and advisors of said monarchs to specific branches of government. Once we have formulated said branches of government, we will be able to more effectively scrutinize incoming legislation and refine it before it is put into law."
liberal_republican_outlook:0 "Above the Ideas of Monarchy"
liberal_republican_outlook_desc:0 "In many ways we find the ideas of old monarchies to be archaic and ill-suited for the people of the United States of America. We can clearly see the ideas of this age and what they espouse as being rational in a variety of ways, and when compared to old traditions that our former overlords clung to, these liberal and republican ideas are better in almost every way at representing the people of this land fairly and justly."
managing_imports_and_exports:0 "Balance Imports vs. Exports"
managing_imports_and_exports_desc:0 "The coast of our up-and-coming state is vast, open to invasion and also open to a variety of trade routes. We would do well to take control of coastal areas through settlements and enforce more authority over both imports and exports so that we can reduce the chance of smugglers getting through whilst also helping encourage domestic trade between states along the coast. There are goods in the north that just aren't found in the south and vice versa."
poential_states_for_statehood:0 "Accepting New States"
poential_states_for_statehood_desc:0 "New land we acquire through settling new towns and villages on the frontier can quickly balloon in population size. Fertile and open land are especially popular with American families and thus, we are going to get fairly rapid settlements as the years go by. Now, we can give land grants fairly easily but we processing applications for statehood takes months to go through, meaning we need to formalize the process over the coming decades and ensure that states can have solid borders and a firm place in our nation."
overarching_unifying_identity:0 "Unity Amongst the Varied States"
overarching_unifying_identity_desc:0 "Our nation is not a nation of one single people. We have folks from all different walks of life that is true, but it is also true that we have folks from various cultural backgrounds and they can contribute to tensions inside these United States if we let them go unheard. We should instead strive to listen to what they have to say, and strive to give them representation in our government so that they feel and know their voices are heard."
militia_to_continental_to_legion_to_army:0 "Transitions of the Military"
militia_to_continental_to_legion_to_army_desc:0 "The military we used to get where we are was hardly a formal military force in comparison to our former overlords. From the days of being town-oriented militias to being something of a true standing army for these United States of America, we are well on our way to organizing a robust military that can protect the liberties we fought for."
move_toward_freedom_of_religion:0 "Let Other Faiths Speak Freely"
move_toward_freedom_of_religion_desc:0 "Religion is a tense subject inside our borders but we have a strong inclination toward being indifferent to religion as a whole. Many vouch for freedom of religion in our land, but there are strong religious communities and strongly religious officials in our government who refuse to let go of having a state-enforced religion. In this context we must work ever so slowly toward separating our politics from our personal religion; this is a land of liberty and freedom, not of religious conformity."

rhodri_and_the_black_gentiles_desc:0 "Rhodri ap Merfyn was 'King of the Britons' according to the Annals of Ulster and through our own records, Rhodri attained a great deal of success for Gwynedd. He annexed Powys and Seisyllwg whilst also holding off invasions from vikings (called 'Black Gentiles' in our old sources), all of which gave a solid foundation for the coming Kingdom of Gwynedd. His military deeds and willingness to defend the Welsh people and their lands from invasions will forever be remembered, and he will be known as one of the greatest rulers in all of Welsh history."

chronicle_of_the_princes_and_more_desc:0 "Brut y Tywysogion, or, the Chronicle of the Princes, is one of the finest and greatest sources of Welsh history that we have with us. It details the deaths of certain important figures, when eclipses happened, when plagues struck, and even events relating to religion in Welsh lands. Though some of our literary tradition has faded since the English annexed our land, we can still bring back the grandeur of Welsh literature and oral tradition for the future; we no longer have the English yoke over us and thus no longer have to abide by their demeaning laws."
commonality_between_gwynedd_pwys_deheubarth:0 "Gwynedd, Powys, and Deheubarth"
commonality_between_gwynedd_pwys_deheubarth_desc:0 "The three principle places of Wales that held historical prominence to us of today are Gwynedd, Powys, and Deheubarth. There were a great number of succession disputes and battles that took place in the lands of all three, yet Welsh people from all three lands came together time and time again to revolt against encroaching English authority in centuries past. We need to focus on this unifying identity of Wales and break down small community barriers so that we can be stronger and more robust internally, since exploiting internal Welsh feuds has historically been what the English did."
eliminate_succession_questions:0 "Affirm Reformed Succession Laws"
eliminate_succession_questions_desc:0 "The succession to power in Welsh lands has always been a tricky thing. Family members feel jealous that they did not get a cut of power or they are acting upon false information that ends up causing untold amounts of damage, all of this ends up hurting Wales internally and making it vulnerable to external influences. By refining our succession laws and ensuring that our heir is affirmed by multiple family members and court members, Wales can finally solve its internal disputes and do away with petty claims to the throne."
celtic_christianitys_legacy:0 "Celtic Christianity"
celtic_christianitys_legacy_desc:0 "The influences of Christianity in Wales are plain for all to see, but so are the influences from how Wales was before Christianity arrived. This sort of Celtic Christianity that developed in Wales and in other places nearby held slightly different views and laws that were not in line with laws set out by the Papacy, meaning that Celtic Christianity was in a sense more open to different views. At the same time, Celtic Christianity was shaped by Welsh people and being very community oriented made for a distinct form of Christianity that could identify foreigners to the subset faith fairly easily."

regularize_welsh_yeoman_desc:0 "Yeoman have been in usage in England for quite some time and Welsh people have historically held the title of 'yeoman' in a variety of places throughout England, but what set Welsh folks apart from English yeoman was the increased usage of the longbow. Though the longbow is being phased out of usage, the Welsh yeoman population are still capable of military combat and should be formalized as time goes on. Giving them proper training and transitioning them to proper gunpowder weaponry with enough discipline will make the Welsh yeomanry a truly grand force."
economic_independence_of_wales:0 "Economic Independence"
economic_independence_of_wales_desc:0 "Another avenue of exploitation that the English used against us was in the way of the Welsh economy. We produce quite a few things like cattle, timber, horses, wax, cheese, and flannel, but we have historically impomrtated salt, wine, and wheat from places like London and Paris. Thus, the English could easily exploit us when they needed to, but now we are in a position to fight back! We have the measures to obtain true economic independence from the English and in time, we can even outclass them in the production of certain materials and resources. All of this relies on our efforts from here on out."

This time of uniting the German people into a singular state with new traditions and ideas at our disposal will prove to be a pivotal time for us. Through our actions here in this coming era of German unification, others around us will know the true power that lies within a German state that has broken down the petty barriers between the various groups such as Saxons, Bavarians, Swabians, and every other Germanic people."

In our current state though, we have the financial power and the administrative power to start strong coal and iron industries throughout Germany. It will be through these industries that we will bring Germany into the industrial age! And it will be an age that we will come to call our own!"

The Fuggers and Welsers have funded a great many projects in our land whilst bringing prosperity to the various German cities all throughout Central Europe. Not only this though, but the German banking families have helped us in regards to getting certain royal family members into key positions of power which goes to show just how influential and smart they can be.

Leading the Holy Roman Empire is something few are capable of doing, but the Austrian people proved to be the ones who were most capable of securing the position as emperor and sustaining it throughout time. It is these Austrian roots of ours and the reputation we have of keeping the throne of the Holy Roman Empire in our realm that helps give us diplomatic prominence."

Austrians have traditionally been at the fringes of Germanic culture in the southeast, bordering the Magyars to the east, the Italians to the south, and the Balkan states in the southeast. So what does this long frontier do for our military personnel? It trains them over time and allows us to enforce more strict borders that are in our favor."

frc_reversing_the_kleinstaaterei_desc:0 "In the centuries of the past, the Holy Roman Empire was the site of and the vehicle in which several once prominent Stem Duchies declined and fragmented into feuding princes and warring states. Now that the Franconian people have transcended these antiquated lines in the sand that were once drawn by petty dukes and bishops, we can promote a policy of harmonious assimilation of people we take into this new German state we have crafted.

They have plagued certain parts of the Holy Roman Empire in the past and even in our up-and-coming German state they are not unheard of since chivalrous knights of old who no longer have traditional work turn to the work of being robber barons. We have our work cut out for us to keep the ones inside our state at bay, but perhaps we can make deals with robber barons in neighboring areas just outside of German lands where lucrative trade routes cross into rural and unprotected land held by our rivals. It may be an underhanded tactic, but one that can easily net Germany a hefty amount of trade income."

Despite the odds against us though, we have managed to overcome the barriers in regards to state unification for the German people meaning that we can address issues in regards to the various social classes in a much more direct way. Whether they are issues concerning nobles of great status, merchants of various guilds, clergy of the various Christian denominations, or even commoners who work the vital farmlands of Germany, we will hear them all and reduce the desire to stir unrest throughout all of Germany."

Perhaps we can set up a sort of administrative sector that can help transition these warriors of the faith toward a regular military career, for if we are able to do so, we will have the stalwart backing of courageous fighters that come from hallowed ancestry."

pom_our_northern_ports_desc:0 "Places in the north like Oldenburg, Hamburg, Lubeck, Rugen, and Stettin are where the majority of German sailors and traders come from as the maritime tradition of the north has had a strong influence on both politics and diplomacy. Emphasizing these northern ports and building up our naval prominence will help encourage merchants to come to our safe coastal cities and build them up to being economic centers."
pom_focus_on_northern_trade:0 "Focus on Northern Trade"
pom_focus_on_northern_trade_desc:0 "Historically the German people have rarely had homes in the south that bordered any sort of coast, thus not allowing us access to Mediterranean trade overall. The north, though, especially in the Baltic Sea, is where German people have been able to contest the likes of Scandinavians and Russians, so why would we not focus our mercantile matters here? Sharpening our metaphorical mercantile blade against our cultural neighbors will only breed German dominance in the markets of Europe."
pom_defense_against_scandinavians:0 "Scandinavian Incursions"
pom_defense_against_scandinavians_desc:0 "The greatest foreign rival to northern merchants and small German states like Wolgast, Rugen, and Mecklenburg has been the Scandinavian people. Denmark and Sweden in particular have skirmished with Pomeranian traders frequently over the centuries, meaning that Pomeranians are especially versed in how to deal with Scandinavian fleets. Perhaps if we eclipse our northern rivals in terms of naval strength, we can bring about a more efficient trade sector stemming from the Baltic Sea."

pom_unparalleled_mercantile_dominance_desc:0 "The combination of German banking with German mercantile methods is something that make European markets and trade centers the economic envy of the entire world. It will be a long road to get to this point since German banking is actively developing and the merchants of our land need to be worked with over time, but if we are consistent in this regard and set up the German economy to be oriented toward harnessing the power of cross-continental trade, Germany will be an unstoppable economic power."

Germans and French people know the significance of this grand river all too well, and since it is in our control, we can practice crossing it routinely with our soldiers so that they know exactly what to do should they face a battle that involves any sort of river crossing."

With this in mind and also the fact that diplomacy was key to maintaining the semblance of power in Rhenish lands, we will be able to cultivate a German state that is capable in its diplomacy and in remembering its heritage."

rhn_the_dreaded_french_desc:0 "If there has been one issue Germans have always faced since the inception of the Holy Roman Empire, it is the dreaded French. Whether through shrewd politics to adept diplomacy to firm military campaigns, the French have invaded eastward against German people for ages now and we have pushed back just as hard as they pushed against us. And who have always been at the front of these French invasions? The Rhenish people, that is who! Through the experiences the Rhenish people have gone through, we will be ready for whatever the French try to throw at us next!"

This history of Swabians attempting to unite together for common political causes is what can help unite other Germans for over-arching political causes, especially in times of war since any threat to our borders is a threat to Germany as a whole. Swabians may be the nucleus of Germany today, but we must bring all Germans together to the common defense of the state."

Drawing upon these various Swabian settlements for extended regiments and to help defend parts of Germany is exactly what we should do in the future, and as we recruit from these numerous Swabian settlements they will stand as a patriotic example to other German people groups like Austrians, Rhenish, and Franconians."

They gave their power to a number of states such as East Francia, the Stem Duchies that followed East Francia's fracturing, and of course the Holy Roman Empire, but most of all they can now give their power to a fully united German state. Perhaps the most prosperous cities of all are the Westphalian cities, but even the other cities throughout Germany can contribute to the administration in more ways than one."

What good is this going to do the Westphalian people alongside every other German people group? We must work a neutral ground of sorts, one where we can work religious disputes in the proper theological circles whilst keeping politics separate entirely. It won't be an easy process for Germany, but with enough manpower and official support, we might just be able to rid ourselves of this religious strife."

This is a fate Germany must never suffer as it is certainly sentencing our state to death by foreign powers encroaching in on a withering corpse. Gearing ourselves toward education and literacy whilst also focusing on building up a meritocratic administration will mean that Germany has what it takes to challenge others across Europe whilst keeping its own politics in check."

Now that a truly unified German state is at hand without the barriers of the old Holy Roman Empire holding back the German people, we can utilize our great docks in the lands of the Flemish and Frisians to utilize charter companies all across the globe.

low_credit_to_germans_desc:0 "Banking is such a prominent part of economies now-a-days that it is a marvel that some economies function without the institution. German banking, especially the banking sectors in Flemish and Frisian lands, is of the highest quality in all of Europe and perhaps even the world, thus giving us a distinct advantage in the world of economics. Not only this, but emphasizing the banking sector of these lands in Germany will steer mercantile matters toward them."

low_a_diamond_in_our_eye_desc:0 "To have a mind for diplomacy and trade is one thing, but to cultivate an economy that can reliably depend on both is another. We are doing just such a thing for Germany as a whole, and should our fellow states near and far fail in their economic aspirations or diplomatic endeavors, they can always turn to Germany for assistance in one way or another. So long as these situations help expand our influence elsewhere, we are always willing to help out."
swi_canton_formalization:0 "Evolve the Swiss Structure"
swi_canton_formalization_desc:0 "Swiss Cantons were always a spectacle to other states in the Holy Roman Empire and those on the outside. None could really emulate our structure of governance and yet, it has given up ample time to know what its strengths and weaknesses are so that we can fix where it falls short and double up on where it excels. In particular this government structure helps instill a strong sense of connected identity that refuses to be broken by even by the strongest of invaders, meaning that when called upon to right cause for all of Germany, we can bring together all German communities and exert unprecedented amounts of force."

swi_memories_of_mercenaries_desc:0 "The age of mercenary troops dominating the fields of Europe is at an end and professional standing armies are becoming more common because of how technology and societies have changed. German society is moving right along with this change, but we are still affected greatly by how influential the mercenaries of our past were. Perhaps if we are able to obtain new contracts in the future for professional foreign armies or vice versa, we can engage in mutually beneficial relations with foreigners on a military level."
swi_defensive_fighting:0 "Discipline in Defensive Fights"
swi_defensive_fighting_desc:0 "Defensive warfare is not the ideal type of warfare for many states since it implies they are on the losing end usually, but Swiss people have been teaching other German people groups that defensive fighting is exactly what can chip away at enemy morale and manpower reserves. Bolstering our fortifications and having concrete exit retreat areas and strategies is what can help German people sustain fewer casualties whilst also keeping the enemy at bay."

swi_swiss_lessons_on_unity_desc:0 "The chronicles of the past for various German people groups are vast, but for the Swiss it is certiainly more focused on attempts at unification alongside what tests the will of people who dare to try and unite the various petty states into one mass. Others in Germany could stand to learn about this in earnest and helping teach the benefits of unification will bolster their confidence in our state over the coming decades. Swiss stories do seem to be timeless tales, do they not?"

The notion of mansabdars has been floated around by many in our administration, but it is only recently that many are waking up to the fact that such a system would do us very well. These mansabdars, who are traditionally in charge of military matters, high civil offices, and provincial governance, will serve the Mughal Empire well into the future and the system of ranks including that of the 'zat' and 'sowar' can be adjusted as time goes on."

no_tribute_but_instead_new_agriculture_desc:0 "When we came upon the subcontinent, we found a distinctly old fashioned system of agriculture in place throughout the various areas past the Khyber Pass. We will be the bringers of a new age of agriculture to this subcontinent and do away with these ineffective old methods of collecting taxes and tribute through agriculture. It will take many months of hard work but instituting these agrarian reforms and placing an emphasis on meritocratic civil administration will help bolster production output and make it easier to develop rural lands all across our empire."

the_ibadat_khana_desc:0 "For a great many centuries, Muslims have ruled lands in Hindustan as minorities amongst Hindu populations. The various Muslim leaders and officials were right to not force conversions upon the Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists they came across, but they did nothing more beyond simply tolerating those outside of Islam in this diverse land. We will build upon this foundation of tolerance and build what is the first in the long line of such functional structures: a House of Worship, or, an Ibadat Khana. No matter their faith, let Muslims converse with Hindus, let Buddhists converse with Christians; all can be welcome into these theological and philosophical places of discussion."

Yet, we are ambitious enough to pursue these architectural goals as we have an influx of Persian influences from the west that are actively being combined with native Hindustani styles. This Indo-Islamic architecture that we are cultivating will be what future generations look upon in awe, and they will enhance our prestige to any foreigner that travels to our land."

zamindars_and_marzabans_desc:0 "Local rulers who are more used to Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist populations than we are lay scattered around our empire, paying lip service to our administration whilst skirting around some regulations we have in place. This cannot stand if we are to continue to expand both internally and externally, which is exactly where the system of zamindars and marzabans comes into play. These zamindars and marzabans will be formalized as time goes on and will be given land grants and the right to collect taxes from their own local populations, but they will also be required to hold down the land with forces from the very population they rule over in accordance with mansabdari forces."

transition_out_of_wars_for_the_throne_desc:0 "For far too long we have suffered under the weight of pretenders rising up and trying to take the throne when the old ruler is close to death. Sons and cousins waging civil war to take the throne for themselves only causes needless suffering and stresses the administration of the Mughal Empire even further than what it already goes through. Thus, it is clear that we must reform the system of succession to our throne and give the sons, daughters, and even nieces and nephews of the current ruler a proper job throughout the administration or military."

proto_industrialization_of_the_subcontinent_desc:0 "The years go by in our empire and throughout its growth, we are seeing villages turn into towns and towns growing into cities. Urban populations are growing like never before, new production techniques are being utilized by textile weavers, and industries such as shipbuilding and metalware and agriculture are growing at unprecedented paces. Whilst our administration might struggle to keep up with how high our internally development is growing, we will be sure to profit greatly from this rising tide of industrial output. We will have little need of outside imports if we can truly harness the power we have here in Hindustan."

The rising power of the Russian people is something that should push this forward so that we can secure ourselves as independent in all church functions, legitimizing our administration in more ways than one over time. Our reliance on outsiders is no more; Russia's rise is now at hand."

These vast lands of Siberia would be far more useful if we were to annex them into Russia, slowly developing them over time and extracting what resources they have so that the more prosperous parts of Russia (like Moscow, Novgorod, and Tver) can grow even more."

Russian cities like Ryazan, Moscow, and Tver have seen countless raids by these fiends in the past and the old power structures were not able to withstand the onslaught of these ruthless marauders, but Russia... Russia is far different from those old states... We will utilize gunpowder weapons in whatever form they may take and we will, through sheer brute force or through skilled seizure of towns and villages, tame these unruly steppe hordes. There will be an end to their terror, and it will be the Russian flag that stands atop their burned out settlements."

They move the earth like no other siege engine before and are far better at breaking into fortifications than ladders, trebuchets, or tunnel digging. Russia's artillery henceforth become one of the strongest in all of Europe, just so long as we can afford to keep them in production and updated as new and better versions are invented by our engineers."

Our lands stretch from horizon to horizon in many places, which means we are going to need a hefty amount of soldiers to ensure that the land is secure when at peace, and also to expand said land when at war. Our solution to this issue is that of cheap soldiers that can be recruited for life; they need not be armed to the point of some other armies in Western Europe, they only need just enough equipment to fight and just enough money to keep them alive, nothing more. They will be cheap, large in number, and willing to fight and die for the motherland."

do_away_with_the_old_boyars_desc:0 "We cannot cling to old social and societal traditions if we are to keep going as a strong and robust empire. Boyars of old noble families are righteous in some senses, but the issue at hand is their noble blood getting them high positions in society when someone more educated and more qualified is available. We need to actively work to break down these old traditions and instill a much more merit-based system of administration so that Russia as a whole can benefit from educated advisors, ministers, and governors."

They need to be working the land and being ready to serve Russia when they are called upon; serfdom is simply going to be the law of the land in the majority of our empire. It may be unappealing to outsiders, but we have no need of these peasants gaining social mobility, no, we need them to keep to their own social class with no objections."

memories_of_sarkoya_gorodishche_desc:0 "It is an old memory, but one that should not be forgotten in Rostov. Before the rise of our city, there was the fortified village of sorts named 'Sarkoya Gorodishche'. There are plenty of mysteries surrounding it but it remains one of the foundational pieces of history for our people and our capital city. Its purpose as a fortified village should be remembered and kept close so that, in the future when we expand Rostov itself, the city expands its own fortifications too."

At first, Rostov-Suzdal took power as things tumbled down, and then Vladimir took Rostov's place and the state became known as Vladimir-Suzdal. And yet, Rostov stood by throughout that time as a strong economic city near the other two, thriving and prospering. We could actually use these old claims from Vladimir-Suzdal to enforce our own expansions throughout these lands, being a worthy successor to the old grand duchy."

a_pillar_of_eastern_orthodoxy_desc:0 "What helped Rostov transform from a small village of sorts into a bustling city of trade and wealth (before the Mongols came through) was the fact that Rostov was a center of Eastern Orthodoxy. From our city many places were converted around us and powerful bishops and archbishops came to be seated either in or very close to Rostov itself. Let us carry forth this religious legacy into the future no matter what happens to our internal politics."

They seek to be the center of Russian Orthodoxy and to have the seat of our faith be in Rostov and Rostov alone. To have a Rostov Metropolitan Bishop is going to be tough as the metropolitan currently has his chair with Moscow, but with enough coercion, internal growth, and decisive political moves, we can get a future metropolitan move the chair to Rostov."

Part of this is the fact that having a fortified city center is a must, especially for capitals like Rostov. If we can work to build up a proper kremlin in the heart of Rostov and ensure it is engineered to withstand any attack whilst also displaying our prosperity, we will earn more trust from our own people and cultivate a stronger capital city."

By fusing powdered glass to a basis of some kind through fiery temperatures, we create beautiful pieces of glass, metal, ceramics, or stone that many value to a high degree.

No, economic growth and political stability are rewards in their own right but they alone are not fit for Rostov and its great past. We of Rostov must look toward battling the other states of the Rus for hegemony over the land and uniting these separate cities such as Novgorod, Moscow, Tver, and Pskov.

It is, however, with great sadness that we remember how brutally our efforts were suppressed; so many civilians and righteous fighters killed as reprisals, and many in the royal family descended of Yaroslav III were executed.

Many see the rise of Moscow on this board as inevitable, but we of Tver refuse this notion altogether. We are ready to hold out in our small corner of the board, complete with fortifications and loyal soldiers at the ready. If we have to draw this chess game out for years and decades to defeat Moscow, we will do exactly that."

rein_in_kashin_kholm_zubtsov_desc:0 "As the 1300s went on and Moscow continued to gain influence, they chipped away at the authority of Tver and made some of its neighboring lands semi-independent (Kashin, Kholm, and Zubtsov). This greatly reduced the power of Tver as a whole and made it into a mere pawn on the Russian chess board, instead of perhaps a bishop or a knight. Now is the time that we must rein in these autonomous lands that Moscow has sought from us; unification is not going to be an option for them, not after they helped bring about our decline in the past."

Learning from the past is not easy, but Tver has been forced to do just that."

During the reign of Mikhail II, he strived to ally the Grand Duchy of Lithuania against Moscow and the Golden Horde, but unfortunately this led to the other princes around Tver invading and dismantling even more of Tver's base of power. Thus, it is these harsh lessons in outside diplomacy that we must learn from so that in the future, we are not hampered by unfortunate diplomatic circumstances."

We have not been able to rely on money and diplomacy like Novgorod, nor have we been able to rely on a stalwart administration to keep us afloat. What matters at the end of it all is military might and Tver has learned this after its failures in the past against not only Moscow, but against the Mongols as well.

The death of Yuri II of Vladimir-Suzdal and the death of Vsevolod Konstantinovich of Yaroslavl meant that the Mongols were able to sack a great many cities, including our very own city that sits on the banks of the Volga River.

We have made buildings out of wood for so long now that stone buildings seem almost strange to many of Yaroslavl, but we cannot deny the fact that if Yaroslavl is to grow and prosper, the wooden buildings need to be replaced with something less prone to fire. Thus, the easiest solution? Stone buildings."

Now that Yaroslavl is looking up in the world, we will look toward introducing these lands back into fold of Yaroslavl through more peaceful and diplomatic approaches; we would rather not expend more military resources than what is necessary if diplomacy works just as well."

weakened_novgorod_authority_desc:0 "As the authority of Novgorod weakened over the 1300s and 1400s, we, the Komi people, have come into our own. Our state is more autonomous than before and we are governing politics in a manner in which Novgorod would never have let happen previously. Now we must still fear the wrath of Muscovite princes here and there, but for now, the Komi people can look forward to a more prosperous future where they can handle their own military and political matters at a certain scale."

ready_to_play_off_three_powers_desc:0 "The three powers that have come to define the 1400s near us are Kazan, Muscovy, and Novgorod. Though we are on the outer perimeter of politics for these three powerful states, the Komi people are not without vision on what political shifts happen to their west and south. If we are to expand our power even slightly, we must be ready to play these three off of each other whenever we can as a subtle yet key 4th Player."

amidst_forests_of_the_komi_desc:0 "Forests and rivers are what dominate the landscape of the Komi. Our state has scattered villages and towns of course, but none can deny that if fights take place in our land, it is among the forests and woods and by the rivers and creeks. If commanders and soldiers don't know how to navigate these lands, they will die by those that do, and just who exactly are the masters of this kind of warfare? The Komi people of course."

cultivate_river_trade_chances_desc:0 "We thrive off trade through the rivers that flow in our land; it is one of the key reasons why Novgorod kept us around as a tributary state of sorts in previous centuries. Thanks to their decline in influence and the steady rise of Komi power though, river trading has become more common and the profits are flowing into our pockets most if not all the time. Establishing more secure river crossings and outposts alongside the rivers will only increase how far we can send our merchants and how much they can bring back with them."
offensive_advantages_stop_here:0 "Permafrost Defense"
offensive_advantages_stop_here_desc:0 "Bolstering our defenses is not an easy thing to do since our lands are harder to develop as a whole. What helps us out in this regard is nature itself as the Komi people have come to partly rely on nature providing partial cover from projectiles and obstacles that large hulking armies can't move around easily. Knowing where these key points of defense are and building more defenses around them will be what can boost the Komi defense strategy by leaps and bounds."

open_up_fields_for_grazing_desc:0 "The lands to the south of our capital are warmer and have less trees in general, meaning they are fit for a different kind of lifestyle. Grazing herds of horses and cattle are much more suited to these conditions as opposed to up north, which is why we will sponsor segments of our population to settle the southern lands and open up more proper fields for grazing herds of animals. These herds should be able to help supply our military with horses and baggage animals alike."

Why, we can begin to build outposts and towers to dot the landscape, intricate in their design and sturdy in their construction so that they cannot be toppled or broken down without a great amount of force. With the amount of timber ready to use too, these fortified outposts and towers will be the bane of any enemies that dare set foot in our land."

once_ruled_partly_by_khans_desc:0 "Beloozero was rife with growth in the times before 1400. What began as a principality detached from Rostov around 1238 grew into a prosperous place ruled by Prince Gleb who married Sartaq Khan's daughter. In this sense, Beloozero was partly ruled by khans of the past and can easily call upon this partial heritage to drum up support for conquests around the Rus. It won't be easy considering how strong Moscow and Novgorod remain as of the 1400s, but Beloozero has seen more drastic shifts in power before."

This isolation is ideal for a defense-oriented warfare which Beloozero's military is already trained in. If our enemies cannot reach the heart of Beloozero without losing a few hundreds or thousands of troops to the cold and forested terrain, we will have far greater chances of eliminating them altogether."

Maintaining these monasteries that were granted to us by descendants of Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow will keep the name 'Beloozero' in the minds of many, in a positive way of course. If Moscow were to give us even more funding for additional prestigious structures, we would only be happy to accept such offers."

a_hand_in_northern_trade_desc:0 "The rural northern lands of the Rus are not completely desolate or isolated; Novgorod has shown us and many others that there are trade routes that run through these lands so that fur can be transported to more western and southern markets. If Beloozero can perhaps build more markets and designate more clearings for traders to pass through, its trade power in the north will rise as time goes on and perhaps even replace Novgorod's trade power."

raise_up_beloozeros_family_desc:0 "Though some would look upon our royal family with a shrug or a roll of the eyes, they aren't as weak as some would predict. The monasteries and markets that they hold sway over have given Beloozero a higher sense of worth and influence all around the northern parts of the Rus, meaning that more and more high minded people are making their way toward our capital city. Let us make room for these intellectuals in our own court, for their skills are exactly what can give Beloozero the edge it needs in the politics of the Rus."

the_borael_forests_shield_us_desc:0 "Much like in the eastern principality of the Komi people, Beloozero is rife with forests that are just waiting to be used for defensive purposes. Though we should avoid building all our structures out of wood for fear of fires being able to spread easily, constructing scattered yet connected defenses in the form of outposts and towers would help keep Beloozero's core safe from harm."

organizing_all_of_the_northern_trade_desc:0 "With unprecedented growth happening all throughout Beloozero, it is only right that we seize all of the trade routes in the north so that we may control all the income that stems from such trade routes. And if southern powers or towns think they can strike at Beloozero's economy in some way (like through embargoes), we can easily cut them off from the vital northern trade routes that supply us. A great deal of the Rus depends on the profits of the fur trade, and us having a powerful grip over it means we will have a powerful grip over other states in the Rus."

The Poles and Lithuanians seek to take over the Baltic whilst Moscow seeks to end Novgorod altogether, and yet we still stand here, ready to defend our state and our principles and what territory that we have fought for in previous centuries. The time is now for us to expand our military arsenal for the coming years of war since we know very well that our traditional rivals are not going to stop fighting against us until they are firmly dead."

sustain_novgorods_economic_importance_desc:0 "Whilst the people of Novgorod participated in economic matters such as catching fish for food, obtaining salt for a number of matters, and growing crops like flax and hops, what has been the life-blood of Novgorod since its inception has been the fur trade. Even as it declines slowly over time due to new sources of fur opening up to European markets, we can still strive to maintain our economic importance by building up markets and towns so that merchants can make more of a profit off of various resources that come from Novgorod. This should go hand-in-hand with keeping control over the northern trade routes of course."

memories_of_the_struggles_against_catholics_desc:0 "Ever since the Teutonic Knights and the Catholic Scandinavians started to look eastward in the 1200s, Novgorod was the one staunch barrier to spreading Catholicism in what was then fairly fresh Eastern Orthodox grounds. This wall against Catholicism has remained stalwart ever since this time period and was shown off in magnificent fashion in the Battle on the Ice in 1242. Like how Alexander Nevsky led Novgorod's forces on that day, we will do so in the future and preserve Eastern Orthodoxy against all Catholic incursions."

Prominent boyar families in our land have and still do commission detailed and elaborate icons and also churches and cathedrals around our land have many detailed icons that show off just how much prowess we have in terms of artistry.

Novgorod is not keen on keeping knowledge from its peasantry, or, at least not to the level of our neighbors. The manuscripts written by either men or women in our land may be read by peasants, merchants, or boyars, all should be able to as time goes on and as more are produced. Some will find this aspect of Novgorod strange, but, we see it as a righteous endeavor; knowledge shouldn't be limited to just those of prominent status."

Denmark, Sweden, and the Hanseatic League will still be thorns in the side of Novgorod's trade sector, but the more time we dedicate to building trade ships and establishing trade relations, the more influence we will obtain over time."
protests_spur_political_development:0 "Listen to the Reasons of Peasants"
protests_spur_political_development_desc:0 "Numerous times since we have existed as an independent political entity there have been peasant protests and some serious revolts. These revolts weren't like the ones we see in the monarchies of Europe though, as they were more aimed wanting better ruling from the upper classes. Thus, when we encounter future protests and riots, we shouldn't meet these people with executions at every turn, we should instead look to what they have to say and learn to compromise at points with those who are, for better or for worse, the majority of the population in our state. Novgorod is not one to oppress its population, not like the princes of Moscow."

We have not sought to cut down our enemies because we know we are not powerful enough (for now, that is), but we will seek out is good trade deals with both our steppe neighbors and our Rus relatives. Guarding these trade routes along the Oka River also gives us a great deal of practice in manning the walls and fortifications we have already built."

caught_between_lithuania_and_moscow_desc:0 "In the early 1400s, our small duchy was the subject of debate and conquest by Lithuania whilst Muscovy's power in the east was on the rise. Though we were snatched by Lithuania firstly in those early decades of the 1400s, Muscovy struck back later on and thus the influence of both powerful states clashed in and around Odoyev itself. If we are to save our lowly capital from destruction akin to what happened in May of 1407, then we must be ready to negotiate at all times with Muscovite princes and Lithuanian grand dukes."
lending_and_receiving_troops:0 "Border Region for Two Giants"
lending_and_receiving_troops_desc:0 "Being that Odoyev is a sort of border region for Lithuanians and Muscovites, it is fitting that we see a fair deal of troop movements across our territory. These troops of course are not always ours as some are clearly mercenary bands hired by either power for their own purposes, but that does not stop Odoyev from perhaps offering these mercenary bands a better deal. They're roaming our land from time to time anyways, why not buy them out and perhaps ensure our own safety?"

tribute_in_exchange_for_land_was_our_status_desc:0 "In the treaty of 1427 between the House of Novosil and Odoyev with the Grand Duke of Lithuania at the time, Vytautas the Great, our leaders would be the subject of the Lithuania and given land within Lithuania itself, so long yearly tribute was paid. This treaty is long since gone due to new leaders and new officials coming to power, but we can still easily press claims we have on Lithuanian land and maybe even land we lost in the east. Tribute for land can be a dangerous deal sometimes, it's just hard to see how bad it could be in the future."

Defending it with whatever we can though is something that is becoming increasingly clear to our own population, this motivation of which we are only too happy to indulge. Whether it is stronger and more deeply laid garrisons or thicker walls for our fortifications, we of Odoyev will be the righteous defender of the Oka River no matter what."

But is that time of conquest truly coming? We simply won't wait to find out as there are too many things to get done in Odoyev! We are a rising bastion of defended trade routes and prosperous state mixed with Russian, Lithuanian, and Tatar people. We will do everything in our power to ensure that Odoyev continues to be a southern bastion of greatness no matter what is imposed on us from any direction."

Striving for power against Kiev in many instances whilst also holding its own power and even helping Kiev at times when it suited Chernigov as a whole, our history is rich with stories of conflict, affection, and prestige. Upholding this heritage of ours and building up Chernigov into a strong power in the region once more will earn us the respect and loyalty of the citizens we rule over."

Though after Mstislav's death Chernigov was integrated back into Kiev for the duration of Yaroslav's reign, the mark Mstislav made was never undone as Chernigov remained a viable competitor to Kiev's administrative power. In time we will make this known once more and re-establish order throughout the old lands of Chernigov as well as all of the Rus."

Still though, there is life in this old city and in the royalty as well as courtiers who still reside in Chernigov and its nearby villages. Promoting developments in agriculture, infrastructure, and even simple road building will go a long way in restoring Chernigov's internal power and authority whilst also ensuring that its economic prospects rebound upward from those lowly times of the 1200s and 1300s."

Renovating the cathedral itself, promoting more religious development through the construction of monasteries, and establishing firm authority for our Orthodox leadership will help cement Chernigov as a bastion of Eastern Orthodoxy in the south of the Rus."

militarized_frontier_area_desc:0 "Few would say that Chernigov is a truly peaceful place; time and time again its lands are crossed by roving bands of cossacks and mercenaries alike. In a sense, these militarized groups have forced our hand in militarizing Chernigov as a whole, even more so than when we faced threats from the Cumans and Kievan civil wars. Formalized training measures, loyal and brave commanders, and a robust system of command that is developed properly over time will give Chernigov the edge it needs to sustain itself, regardless of the threats that come forth."

adaptation_to_steppe_warfare_desc:0 "If it was not for the steppe hordes to our south and southeast, where would Chernigov be? Perhaps much better off or perhaps integrated fully into the Kievan Rus, but that would take away the valuable lessons we have learned over the generations in regards to how they fight. Unlike the traditional shield walls and heavy infantry/cavalry charges our northern neighbors were used to, we have grown up around both those tactics and steppe horde tactics being used on us extensively. Utilizing these tactics in the form of an organized light cavalry arm that can skirmish effectively will put Chernigov well ahead of other states in the Rus."

Angering them through forced conversion would simply cause undue tension and unrest and slow down our economy, so in the interest of our state as a whole instead of just the clergy themselves, we will take steps to formally recognize these minorities and protect them."

Excluded from grand princely succession due to how the lineage lined up in dynastic matters during the days of the Kievan Rus, he took matters into his own hands and pillaged parts of the Kievan Rus, laid siege to Pskov without success, pillaged and burnt Novgorod for the benefit of his cathedral in Polotsk, and he even came close to cutting off the sons of Yaroslav from valuable northern trade. During the Kiev Uprising of 1068, the crowds freed Vseslav from his captivity (since he lost the Battle of the Nemiga River in 1067) and placed him on the throne, though only for a single year. Still, he made Polotsk into a serious force to be reckoned with and we will follow in his very footsteps!"

Though this is very much not the case anymore since the Kievan Rus is long dead and Polotsk has witnessed a staggering decline since Vseslav's generation, we can still make an effort to rebound upward and fortifiy our capital once more. It will take years of manpower and money, but it will be worth it in the end so that we can promote a strong and cultivated capital city."

lessons_on_dyanstic_bonds_desc:0 "Polotsk made several ties to local communities and polities near the Baltic coast, but these dynastic bonds did not stop the incoming tide of crusading knights from the west that plagued our various allies and family members. Still though, this period of mingling with and forming relations with foreign states taught us the value of dynastic bonds. They can be useful far into the future and can help promote influence in lands still controlled by hostile forces, such as the Teutons in our case."

In his raiding and pillaging of Novgorod, he looted Novgorod's own Cathedral of Holy Wisdom and took its bell as well as other decorations back to Polotsk. Even though some from Novgorod petition us to give back these holy relics and prestigious decorations, we have no need to do so; they make our grand cathedral even more beautiful and allow for more relations to be fostered with Christian states that aren't inside the Rus."

We are lucky that both the Teutonic range of influence is shrinking more and more thanks to the work of the Polish, Lithuanians, and even some Teutonic administrators themselves. Soon enough it will be Polotsk's turn to stick a blade into the bleeding knight trying to hold on to what influence it has; it is only a matter of time."

This time of being forced to work the land for a different nation wasn't all bad though as it helped us develop a stronger and more robust infrastructure as well as a greater understanding of how to plan out our capital's expansion.

We were integrated into Lithuania after this point on, but now that we are free from that old integrated past, we can utilize the lessons that Vyutautas imparted onto Smolensk's military.

But even despite all of these hardships we have been through, the people of Ryazan carry on and righteously defend what is their own.

These times of breaking down and being unable to control politics must be rectified if we are ever to become as strong as we once were; we must learn to control how succession works, how feuds are handled, and how politics stretching from town to town and region to region are handled.

After this adoption of Islam though, it wasn't enforced heavily through imams and strict legalist approaches; not even alcohol was banned by the Golden Horde back then. Just as it was back then, we too will take this relaxed approach to Islam as a state religion; we will not enforce it as heavily as some other states do, and we will not take every single doctrine of Islam to heart.

It was disastrous and let the state lapse further and further downward, something we wish to never see again for the good of all of Aragon.

That is where the fueros of Aragon come into play as we have used them before when conquering lands in Iberia, but they were less formalized than what we truly want.

five_rivers_of_the_great_indus_desc:0 "There are five rivers in the north that flow into one main heart that is the Indus River, going southward and giving fresh irrigation to a variety of people and communities that have thrived here for centuries without end. Punjab can be said to be where the Indus River starts its journey, and it is here that some of the most valuable lands by the Indus River are found. Thus, we will have an easier time developing them upward into something resembling an urbanized region as we go on."

gateway_to_bharat_and_iran_desc:0 "Punjab is a place of movements into and out of Bharat's northwestern sector. Being that it is lucrative for development, trade routes, and military strategies from various states in general, it would be wise to capitalize on these alluring aspects of our region. We can take in new ideas from afar and bolster our own revenue stream if we simply play our cards right in the various shifts of international politics."

honest_work_of_sufi_saints_desc:0 "Our proximity to Iranian lands has been met with hostilities at times, yet it has also allowed for a great deal of sufi saints to make their way into Punjab. These various sufis are hailed by many locals as hard workers, benevolent individuals, and graciously pious in their ways despite whatever political shifts happened above. Despite how Punjab has developed around Sikhism today, we should still give honor and thanks to the sufis of the past and present as the work they do is still very key to having Punjab stay together."

cultivate_this_granary_of_bharat_desc:0 "Various foreigners and merchants have given the name 'granary of Bharat' to the Punjab region and that isn't without merit; we do produce a great amount of crops every single year and it was helps us influence the trade routes around us. If we can get the farmers and their respective plots of land to use more innovative irrigation methods whilst we of the administration reform how we deal out plots of land as a whole, we will be able to ensure that the production of various goods in Punjabi lands is never in doubt."

militant_sikh_communities_in_use_desc:0 "Firearms, centralization, and even religious tensions growing ever more intricate, all of these factors and more play a role in how Punjab's communities are developing as a whole. We are seeing widespread militant ideas coming to the attention of our administration and often times skirmishes in rural areas near foreign borders with Punjab are taken care of by these militant communities instead of our actual regiments of soldiers. We need to reach out and work with these militant Punjabis so as to prevent unintended future conflicts and to bolster our own military ranks."

centralization_instead_of_confederacy_desc:0 "Once we have established a firm grasp on the militant locals and religious matters inside Punjab, making these various Punjabi people and their neighboring cultures see eye-to-eye is something that will take a very long time. Yet it is a project spanning generations of time that we of Punjab are willing to undertake so that we can have a formalized administration without the need for harsh reprisals or increasingly shady ties through advisors and royal families."

to_defend_sikhism_is_to_defend_punjab_desc:0 "It has never been in doubt that Sikhism is what underpins much of the Punjabi unity we enjoy today. It is a small religious movement compared to the pious giant that is Islam and the wise titan that is Hinduism, but it is not without its vehement supporters and ardent defenders. Going forward, Sikhism will continue to play a central role in Punjabi affairs both on a local and administrative level, and the Sikh warriors that vow to defend the faith will be welcomed into Punjabi military ranks as well. Their discipline is not just for the movement founded by Guru Nanak, it is for all of Punjab."

loya_jirga_of_ages_past_desc:0 "Within our tribal system of loyalties and hierarchy, the loya jirga is a special assembly convened in the case of a sudden and unexpected change in governance (death, rebellion, code of laws being changed, etc.). Through consulting the loya jirga regularly when we know there is a major shift in governance happening, we will secure a much stronger base of loyalty amongst our various people as they know intrinsically that such an assembly of the people is needed in order to properly ordain that which rules the Pashtun people."

pashtunwali_stays_true_desc:0 "What has been the main part of our way of life for centuries upon centuries now is something that all Iranians should look to for guidance to some degree. Pashtunwali stipulates four main principles: Hospitality, Asylum, Justice, and Revenge. There are other facets of Pashtunwali that we adhere to like arbitration and respect, yet those first four are the foundational principles that we should go by. And when an invader seeks to do us wrong by tarnishing our land and our state, we will enact righteous justice and revenge upon them."

practice_hit_and_run_in_the_hindu_kush_desc:0 "We cannot rely on large standing armies full of professional soldiers; our land and our state is simply not built for such measures. What we are much more inclined to do is to levy troops from various tribes for battle and call upon tribal mercenaries when we can for extra support, and what both groups tend to specialize in is hit-and-run tactics. The introduction of firearms has made doing such hit-and-run maneuvers much easier, thus allowing our military forces to strike quicker and more deadly blows against the enemy."

Pashtun leaders are no stranger to ghulams as they have become integral to making sure that the heartland of the Pashtun people stays safe, and integrating them bit by bit into our growing Pashtun state will help reduce the cost of hiring them for future campaigns."

internal_disputes_without_end_desc:0 "Despite what we do to cultivate a strong state for the Pashtun people, tribal feuds and disloyal locals continue to plague our administration. Often times we have tried to reason with these tribes of our land since they are also Pashtun most of the time, but we have seen quite a few of these attempts fall through and result in outright violent uprisings against us. Such revolts in the future will be seen as enemies of the state entirely and we will use every resource available to us to rein in these misguided fools."

remember_to_consult_the_tribal_council_desc:0 "What must never be forgotten as time goes on is to consult the tribal council itself that is central to whatever Pashtun state rules over the land, for it is from the tribal council that partly where the administration derives its power from. By including the tribal council on various decisions from economic policies to trade deals and military spending, the Pashtun people will know that they are being listened to in full."

masterful_defensive_plays_desc:0 "We do not live where it is easy to thrive and succeed, but rather where life is tested to its very limits with each passing generation. Some valleys are rife with life and opportunity, yes, but most places in the Hindu Kush mountains are hard to traverse, full of blazing heat, thin air, and sometimes even biting cold. Such conditions will make our defensive positions in the Hindu Kush mountains all the more favorable, and enemy seeking to root out the Pashtun people will need to shed more blood than they ever thought possible in order to do so."

Coming into our service as of late are the so-called 'Qizilbash' who are mainly Turkoman in origin and Shiite in religion; their weapons lent to the various sufi orders of the land have helped them become prominent forces all throughout Iran. Utilizing their military prowess throughout our land is what can and will propel us further than ever before, yet we must be wary of how influential they truly are as our politics evolve."

Though it has changed quite a bit as of today with Islamic elements being now integral to the practices of pahlevani inside our many zourkhaneh (translated as 'houses of strength'), these various forms of strength training for military and our civilians is what will help sustain our martial skill as time goes on."

Yet, it is not just the intangible that changes as we Iranians do, but it is also the tangible elements of architecture that change too. Our mosques and gardens utilize local materials and local traditions to help give the structure a uniquely blended style, adding to the flourishing culture across all of Iran. Consequently, this usage of local materials and traditions also cuts down on the expenses we need to use for taking on such ambitious building projects."

per_edge_defense_instead_of_inner_defense_desc:0 "The mountains of Iran are not invincible; the Arab invasion of 637 proved that fact to us. Still, they are a great natural barrier to invaders coming through, and the edges of our state are at a far greater risk of enemy invasion than the heart of our land in cities like Tehran and Isfahan. Establishing a stronger presence in these far territories of ours and keeping the locals in these far reaches under a closer watch will help keep our state alert and ready in the future."

per_the_growth_of_carpet_making_desc:0 "The weaving of carpets has been in Iranian history for generations as we all know, but we are now witnessing perhaps one of the greatest explosions in creativity for the art of carpet weaving. New patterns include carpets with spiral/tendril designs, floral ornaments, the depiction of flowers and animals, and some even achieve a mirrored design for an added layer of beauty. Truly these works of art are going to be sold for great amounts and this streamlining of the carpet making process is going to ensure that our economic prospects are never in doubt for the future."

If we create other branches to go alongside the gholam, then we will be able to balance things out politically and also incorporate more gunpowder weapons into our military. Three other main branches can and will be put forth: the Shahsevans (friends of the king), the Tofangchis (musketeers), and the Tupchi (artillery-men); through these four branches, we will become a truly modern military power."

Those of our land, however, are larger in scope and placed in strategic locations across our lands alongside guards who collect road tolls so that traders and visitors passing through have an easier time getting from place to place in peace. It can be said that if one ensures the safety of traders and travellers throughout their land, prosperity in turn is also ensured."

lur_kurdish_allies_desc:0 "To our west in Mesopotamia, we see a variety of changes taking place over time. Kurdish tribes migrate, Arabian bands of people move around, and even Turkic people move through and sometimes settle down. What we observe regularly though is the increasing presence of Kurdish tribes in the region thanks to us securing the heartland of Iran to the east of Mesopotamia. If we can reliably ally these Kurdish tribes and bring them closer to our administration, we will have a great source of devoted fighters for our future conflicts, especially in western areas like the Levant and Arabia."

It is in this grand defensive nature that we can find refuge in the most dire times."

lur_diminshed_religious_rigidity_desc:0 "We can learn much from the more spaced out people of Iran such as the Lurs. For far too long now there has been a sense of strict religiosity across the lands from Tabriz to Herat; it causes divides and struggles between muftis, imams, and whole communities that could otherwise be avoided entirely if a more practical approach to religion was taken. As we come to power in future decades, we will take steps to emphasize local practices and traditions with regards to religion so as to dampen the flames of religious zealotry in our land. If we can garner the loyalty of our own faithful people regardless of their exact theology, then we will be able to bend the greater religious institutions to our own will."

lur_open_to_different_politics_desc:0 "Being that Iran has a variety of different Iranian branches of people encompassing its greatest cities and its halls of power, it would seem natural that different politics arise in the various areas under our authority. Indeed this is what we see as some places retain a tribal hierarchy and some places retain a much more theocratic hierarchy. Learning to adapt these politics toward our central administration and meeting the various people half way with regards to what can and should be done for them will help bring a sense of peace and stability to our lands."

These lands are havens for farmers and land owners alike as they produce some of the most valuable crops in all of our land, all whilst remaining productive at regular intervals year after year. Cultivating this region further with new technologies will only serve to bolster our grain reserves and food markets."

maz_dabuyid_memories_desc:0 "The transition out of the Sassanian Empire and into the era of Islam for Iranian people was one rife with chaos and instability. For those of the north, the Dabuyids and their descendant dynasties that were the Qarinvandids and Bavandids resisted the invasion of Muslims for generations before finally losing it all in their revolt agianst the Abbasid Caliphate around 783. Despite their losses and the fading grandeur of the Dabuyid descendants, we still revere the efforts of these noble lineages through tombs and monuments alike. Recognizing the greatness of our own past in recent times will ensure the populace that we are not ignorant of their extensive history."
maz_caspian_trade_routes:0 "Look to the North"
maz_caspian_trade_routes_desc:0 "Trade in the southern reaches of what is traditionally held as Iranian land is becoming harder and harder to profit from since Arabian tribes and foreign powers are making life for traders less than lucrative. In the north, though, we have untapped potential in trade routes across the Caspian Sea. Building a few more ports and sustaining a few more docks on what we control of the Caspian Sea could land us some very prosperous trade deals compared to what we can obtain in the south."

maz_old_autonomous_tributary_status_desc:0 "Though the descendants of the Dabuyids were subjugated by the Abbasid Caliphate, the caliphs neglected to truly make the lands of the Qarinvandids and Bavandids subjects of the caliphate; instead the lands were almost completely autonomous and pledged fealty to the caliphate in name only for generations without end. It is this kind of fully autonomous subject-overlord relationship that we must overcome in the future if we are to cultivate stronger diplomatic and administrative influence. We will be unlike the Abbasid Caliphate of the past as they tried to rein in Iranian lands; we will rectify what subject-overlord contracts we must to ensure we get what belongs to us."

kur_independent_kurdish_fighting_experiences_desc:0 "From the Shaddadids to the Marwanids, and from the Hasanwayhids to the Ayyubids, Kurdish people and indeed the western edge of Iranian people in general have cultivated great amounts of influence in places across the Islamic world, but the light of these western expansions has been halted for a great amount of time now. Still, the memories of intense warfare and struggles for power remain in the various tribes and groups of Iranian people in the west; we would do well to harness their might in the form of an expanded military wing focused on securing and expanding into places like the Levant, Arabia, and Egypt."
kur_various_interpretations_of_religion:0 "Religious Interpretations Spread"
kur_various_interpretations_of_religion_desc:0 "The way various people of our land interpret theology, philosophy, and even moral values themselves is subject to change depending on where one goes. In some places, Shiite Islam under a certain school of jurisprudence may reign supreme; in others, Yazidi beliefs permeate the scattered people of the land; and yet in still other places, Christianity is spread alongside Islamic and Jewish beliefs. Recognizing and attempting a policy of cooperation with these various religious communities that do not follow what our state holds as true can and will lead us to greener pastures in the future, but we cannot falter in this effort for unity and recognition."

Currently there is no place to learn such stories, but that will soon change! We will undertake an effort to start writing down these legends and myths of old into tomes and books so that future generations may read them without trouble, and so that the memories of ancestors can be preserved despite the loss of elders over time."

We should work toward patronizing more artisans and looking toward new ways of making certain goods that we are known for making so that we can continue to be on top of the world in terms of valued commodities. From new ways to refine wood to new methods of securing dyes from plants, all of it will go toward bolstering our expertise in artisan goods."

Still though, we see several dynasties that rule parts of our land that can trace their ancestry all the way back to the times of the Abbasid Caliphate and before! Truly these families deserve a great degree of attention and respect, but they also deserve a great amount of work to keep them from usurping our hold on power. With the great dynasties inside our realm under lock-and-key, we shall be all the more centralized as time goes on."

The sufi orders in particular are perhaps some of the most well known parts of our Islamic history. From the Chishti Order to the Ni'matullahi Order, and from the Shattari Order to the Safaviyya Order, they have followers all across our land and beyond, particularly in the lands to our east in the subcontinent of Hindustan. Wealthy patrons from there including sultans and nawabs alike fund the sufi orders of our land via patronage for sufi members to visit and settle down, thus invigorating the religiosity of our state even more."

The stability brought forth by our state in recent times has given birth to a rising amount of traders coming from the east and west, meaning we are gaining influence in both directions with regards to mercantile matters.

Despite them having feuds and differences that broke down relations in the past, we have been able to resolve a great many of them since our unification into a single state, meaning we can recruit intellectuals and well read individuals from each group.

Not even the remote places in the Hindu Kush are safe from the coming tide of new assets and commodities, yet what is done with them by the writers and poets of our land is what will help these changes last forever.

Zoroastrian traditions are scattered throughout various pockets of our land too just as Hindu celebrations and ceremonies fill in niche parts of our eastern sector, but all too often these various religious influences clash due to how zealous clerics and nobles try to force their faith on to others. Perhaps it is time we work to cleanse our politics of these religious tones and bloodshed; it could help stabilize the state and serve as a catalyst to help resolve age-old disputes that were emboldened by official religious backing."

Through centuries of victories and defeats on both sides, dynastic lineages have crossed over and several claims to legitimacy are hazy at best, but that does not impede our progress as a unified Iranian state. These conflicts that in turn bred the mixing of Arabian and Iranian cultures has given us ample fuel for conquest both in the form of claims and in the form of methods of governance."

The Turkic people created the Seljuk Empire some centuries ago, yet their population did not come into steep conflict with Iranian people like how the Arabs did; instead there has been a sort of intermingling of sorts in several areas we call our own today. It is thanks to this intermixing of Turkic and Iranian people in several areas that we can say with confidence that we can and will work with the Turkic communities of our land to keep politics from unfolding in the future."

wes_ary_hajj_ports_and_trade_cities:0 "Hajj Ports & Trade Hubs"
wes_ary_hajj_ports_and_trade_cities_desc:0 "In the lands of the Gujarati people, there are several ports with lively urban centers and thriving dockyards that see ships coming and going from across the western waters. These places are important places of trade, yes, but they are also important places for Muslims going on Hajj as they are easy to access comparitvely safe to travel from. Ensuring these 'Hajj Ports' are safe year-round will open them up to not only increased population movement, but also increased trade revenue."
wes_ary_refined_taxation_and_cultivation:0 "Lively Cultivation Measures"
wes_ary_refined_taxation_and_cultivation_desc:0 "The fertility of Bharat's land is varied as many know if they travel around, but that doesn't stop taxes from flowing and crops from growing. Technology advances ever more in Bharat's land and we should be using this technology to streamline the cultivation of crops, organize the division of labor from area to area and region to region, and refine the taxation practices handed down to us from generations before."
wes_ary_marathas_mass_of_warriors:0 "Warriors across Bharat"
wes_ary_marathas_mass_of_warriors_desc:0 "Warfare has shaped several parts of Bharat's history in ways similar to how the interactions between religions in its past have come to shape its intellectual stances. Whilst warfare is becoming more oriented to organized armies with gunpowder at the ready, we must never forget the soldier at the bottom of the list: the peasant soldier. In dire times they have been relied on for the defense for various communities and states across Bharat's long history, but today we can shape them into a sizable population ready for recruitment and ready for training."
wes_ary_regardless_of_your_religion:0 "Regardless of Religion"
wes_ary_regardless_of_your_religion_desc:0 "Philosophy and theology, two subjects intertwined from their roots to their branches in Bharat! An extensive history of religious dialogue is found across the subcontinent stretching all the way back before the times of Satavahana Empire and the Gupta Empire. Whether it has been Jain ascetics interacting with Shaktists, Shaivists interacting with Mahayana Buddhists, or even a Vaishnavist interacting with an Ibadi Muslim, Bharat has and will continue to be a grand home for religious dialogue across several spectrums."
wes_ary_integrating_the_purbiyas:0 "Gunpowder Arm of Bharat"
wes_ary_integrating_the_purbiyas_desc:0 "The vastness of Bharat's land means there are several autonomous communities that our government has a hard time keeping track of, and it is in these autonomous communities that we find several instances of 'purbiya', mercenary soldiers skilled with gunpowder weapons (and mainly of Rajput origin). Though enforcing more laws on these communities where they live is going to be hard and expensive, we can at the very least work to integrate the purbiyas into Bharat's military as a more elite gunpowder arm to bolster the effectiveness of our armies, albeit at the cost of a little bit of money here and there."
wes_ary_saurashtri_merchant_ventures:0 "Mercantile Voyages Westward"
wes_ary_saurashtri_merchant_ventures_desc:0 "Since the fall of the Chola Empire centuries ago, these lands of ours have rarely seen extensive mercantile voyages to far off lands in search of opportunity both for trade and for increased political influence. Whilst the latter is certainly harder to achieve for now, the former is looking more and more likely thanks to the safety we project across our coastal cities. Adventuring traders of Saurashtri, Tamil, Tamil, and Bengali heritage are petitioning our administration to charter voyages across the ocean so that they can bolster our trade influence and line their own pockets; why haven't we funded them earlier?"
wes_ary_honoring_ancestors_of_all:0 "Honor Every Ancestor"
wes_ary_honoring_ancestors_of_all_desc:0 "One facet that Muslim dynasties helped bring to the attention to Hindu, Jains, and Buddhists alike is that of monumental buildings. Truly the places built to honor the dead ancestors of these dynasties are magnificent in their size and beautiful in their details, just like how several temples of Hindu and Buddhist origin are intricately designed and built to honor various deities or key figures. Going forward from here, constructing similarly monumental structures for revered ancestors would go a long way to showing our respect for others in our land, not just our own core people."
south_supremacy_of_architecture:0 "Unrivaled Architecture"
south_supremacy_of_architecture_desc:0 "All across our land, we can see that there are many buildings that have been erected by people of various times, faiths, and cultures, but what are we to do in light of these accomplishments? Why, we should attempt to build more monuments when and where we can so we can take our place amongst the giants of our past! From temples to statues to palaces, all of Bharat will know just how much effort we put into everything we construct."
south_rocketry_of_india:0 "Rockets in Action"
south_rocketry_of_india_desc:0 "Gunpowder weapons have been used across our subcontinent for a while, but refining the usage of them into muskets alone has taken quite a while. We struggle sometimes in using these now standard weapons effectively, but with time we will master them both their smaller and larger forms; muskets and rockets alike will become the backbone of Bharat's military. Eventually, if we develop the larger weapons over time, we could be seeing rockets used in pitched battles as well!"
south_malayali_poetry_in_action:0 "Blossoming of Poetry"
south_malayali_poetry_in_action_desc:0 "The Tamil and Malayali people have a very extensive history of literature in general with poets writing poetry many hundreds of years ago. This appreciation for literature that our ancestors bestowed upon a very sizable portion of our population is strong even to this day, so much so that we would be foolish to let it grow on its own. Building libraries, sponsoring poets, and encouraging education for our general populace so that they too can take part in the rich literary tradition of Bharat is something we are obligated to do."
south_dialogue_across_religions:0 "Speak Clearly; Act Softly"
south_dialogue_across_religions_desc:0 "Religious divides have struck down several regions before; we have even heard of the turmoil that has gone on inside the Iranian lands to our west ever since the fall of the House of Sasan. Yet, our home subcontinent has been home to a plethora of religious traditions stemming from some common sources, none of which were actively hostile to each other like how sects of Islam or Christianity were to each other. Fostering this attitude of peaceful and insightful religious dialogue will be the driving force for Bharat's theological and philosophical inner peace."
south_monpolize_subcontinent_trade:0 "From Cuttack to Ahmedabad"
south_monpolize_subcontinent_trade_desc:0 "All across the waters around us, trade ships flow back and forth bringing valuable materials to distant people and ports. We are the center of this crossing since we have several ports along the coast where these oceanic ships dock at to conduct trade. Building up these docks and coastal towns will only grow our advantage even more and attract wealthy merchants from East Africa, Sumatra, and beyond."
south_rough_terrain_movements:0 "Paths Across the Subcontinent"
south_rough_terrain_movements_desc:0 "A varied landscape, this subcontinent we call home is nothing short of wondrous in terms of the beautiful natural sites all across, but often times these places are hard to traverse for humans and animals alike. Carving out paths through jungles and hills throughout our land so that civilians and military caravans can get through will save time when going from place to place and also bolster the amount of trade that can happen between our various cities."
south_lets_dance_the_night_away:0 "Let's Dance the Night Away"
south_lets_dance_the_night_away_desc:0 "Wonderful music, elaborte dances, glorious festivals, and unrivaled blending of cultures together, that is one of the many facets that Bharat brings to the world stage. We work toward a cultural understanding across languages and across religions so that in the future we may live a more harmonious and a more prosperous life; whether it is people practicing Garba or people dancing at the Festival of Colors (otherwise known as Holi), we will bring people together in uplifting celebration."
hindu_oh_so_many_different_people:0 "Bharat's Many People"
hindu_oh_so_many_different_people_desc:0 "Whether it is the Ganges River and its fertile land or the wondrous trade ports across Bharat's coast, these lands that we have consolidated into one state have been the home to several different groups of people across the ages. Bharat is perhaps the first instance of state that has fully unified the subcontinent in its entirety and it is the prime directive of Bharat to manage, integrate, and come to peace with its great variety of people."
hindu_confluence_of_several_matters:0 "Bharat: Confluence Central"
hindu_confluence_of_several_matters_desc:0 "Religious ideas, trade routes, and conquering lords, all three have come through the subcontinent throughout its extensive history. This storied past makes it a central hub for the mixing of various cultures and religions in general, but who are we to say one is inherently more valuable than the other? Though we patronize Hindu traditions the most, we should always be aware of the influence and the value other groups (both religious and cultural) have imbedded within them."
hindu_the_many_languages_of_bharat:0 "Languages like People"
hindu_the_many_languages_of_bharat_desc:0 "When a foreigner comes to visit Bharat, they often are mystified not only by the religious traditions, but also by the languages our people speak as well. They seem as plentiful in variety as there are colors visible to the human eye, and we of Bharat are keen on seeing them used in their local communities instead of being replaced by one courtly language. Respect for the mother tongue of others is what will grant Bharat a step up in the administration of far flung pieces of land."
hindu_understanding_punjabi_developments:0 "Acceptance and Compromise"
hindu_understanding_punjabi_developments_desc:0 "Despite our efforts to make peace with various cultures and people groups in Bharat's extensive swaths of land, there are quite a few that still seek to rise up and take matters into their own hands via hostilities. We must not only keep ourselves armed and ready for these uprisings, but also work to compromise with these locals; understanding their plight and attempting to meet them halfway with certain requests can go a long way in ensuring Bharat's stability."
hindu_layers_of_defense:0 "Protection of Bharata Khanda"
hindu_layers_of_defense_desc:0 "Fortifications are nothing new to Bharat, just like they are nothing new to our neighbors to the far east and to our direct west. What stands out in this observation though is the fact that many fortifications across Bharat are unequal in construction quality and how up-to-date they are. Enacting a series of sweeping defensive reforms to help bolster these fortifications to more modern standards will keep the core regions of Bharat safe from harm. Bharata Khanda will never be exposed to the harsh outside elements of the world like in the past, not again."
east_ary_mass_transport_of_everything:0 "The Bengal Hub"
east_ary_mass_transport_of_everything_desc:0 "For centuries we have seen the Bengal Delta be a great hub for trade, transportation, and growth in a variety of areas... If you can survive the seasonal floods, that is. What is clear to all in the administration of Bharat is that the Bengal Delta must become the virtual heart of the oceanic trade around our homeland; building markets, promoting shipbuilding, and developing the land so that traders from afar come to us instead of others, that is what will garner Bharat a lavish income."
east_ary_stone_works_for_defenses:0 "Against the Mountains"
east_ary_stone_works_for_defenses_desc:0 "The Nepali people are rich in traditions and culture, but they are also fierce in their defense of what is seen as their own territory. Bharat has a mutualistic relationship with most Nepali communities, thankfully, and their defensive posture is exactly what Bharat needs with regards to protecting itself. New fortifications, stronger building materials, and defending at the right points across the land, that is what Nepali advisors focus on for now, and it is what we will listen to for the good of Bharat."
east_ary_remember_the_in_between_people:0 "Forgotten, but not for Bharat"
east_ary_remember_the_in_between_people_desc:0 "Often times there are so many people caught between major states in history, particularly when it comes to terrain that is harsh and divided with ravines and mountains. Bharat is no stranger to such lands and people, meaning that there are a great number of forgotten people that are still integral to making various districts and states functional. Working to recognize them as a whole, and integrating them within our current administrative framework will yield more cooperative local communities and also a stronger base of loyal citizens."
east_ary_three_principle_religious_traditions:0 "Input from the Three Traditions"
east_ary_three_principle_religious_traditions_desc:0 "The main three religious traditions that have influenced Bharat so far in its formation are Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam. There are certainly other, smaller traditions, but these three present the most pertinent groups of interest that we must address going forward as a nation. Instead of promoting one over the other, or trying to play one group off of another, we should be working to facilitate cooperation between the three so that Bharat can focus on other matters in general."
east_ary_the_respect_of_the_three:0 "Respect for the Three Traditions"
east_ary_the_respect_of_the_three_desc:0 "In working to ensure cooperation between our three main religious traditions, we have learned to respect all three in equal amounts. Through meeting with various imams and emirs, brahmins and pandits, and also monks and ascetics alike, we are growing our knowledge day by day alongside the loyalty of our people. There are rough patches, of course, but we seek to address them in the light of day instead of invoking one religion over another to stifle dissent and unrest."
east_ary_assimilation_over_time:0 "Hospitality and Understanding"
east_ary_assimilation_over_time_desc:0 "We can learn a lot from seeking out the history of some of the lesser known people of Bharat, and one of those people groups are that of our northeast, where the Ahom Kingdom once lived. Their own history is very much that of rises and falls intermixed with heavy amounts of assimilation of other people groups from the outside as they moved to be near the Bhramaputra River. If we can learn from this, and other histories that we are looking into, and have a focus on assimilation of people that come into the fold of Bharat, then we will undoubtedly have a more righteous reputation with outsiders."
east_ary_discipline_of_the_himalayas:0 "Rigor of the Himalayas"
east_ary_discipline_of_the_himalayas_desc:0 "Bharat must be protected by a firm military, as every state in this ever-changing world is finding out, yet the training for Bharat's own soldiers are scattered and ill-defined. Promoting more centralized training aimed at the Himalayas (or really any other mountainous region) will help get our soldiers used to harder conditions in general. It might take longer to get suitable soldiers through the process in general since the mountains can be rather deadly at times (which is why we do not use elephants up there), but the end product will be well worth the effort."
cen_ind_tales_from_ages_past:0 "Making History by Writing"
cen_ind_tales_from_ages_past_desc:0 "There are hundreds if not thousands of tales of lineage and descent across the lands of Bharat, but they are passed down not in the writings of scholars or scribes but instead in the hearts and minds of various royals of both small and large dynasties. Learning about these tales as we thrive and prosper leads only to a stronger understanding of who actually makes up Bharat and what has helped shape it into the very state it is today. Let us chronicle these tales in official texts for future generations, for they deserve to be known by all."
cen_ind_out_of_the_deep_tropics:0 "Tropical Upbringing"
cen_ind_out_of_the_deep_tropics_desc:0 "Geography has blessed Bharat with plenty of rain and rivers for growth, yet that has also been a menace to some states and people as tropical weather and terrain makes movement and development difficult. But over thousands of years, Bharat's many people groups have carved out livings in the various environments around the subcontinent not least of which is the humid and tropical regions. Taking advantage of these regions will only enhance how Bharat can fight in future wars what with knowledge of rough terrain and environments being inherent in us already."
cen_ind_nature_will_provide:0 "Recognition of the Smallest Faiths"
cen_ind_nature_will_provide_desc:0 "Hidden within the densest jungles and driest deserts of Bharat, there are communities of people that hold strange beliefs and customs. They contribute to our nation via taxes and production of materials, yes, but the enforcement of various religious laws upon these isolated and hard-to-reach communities has been very hard for many generations even before Bharat became unified. Perhaps it is time we give recognition to these small sects and traditions instead of trying to root them out; they could bring a degree of theological insight that our scholars have yet to come across."
cen_ind_the_art_of_terrain_movements:0 "Shift the Ground, Reap Rewards"
cen_ind_the_art_of_terrain_movements_desc:0 "Bharat is a nation of the earth, the very earth that gives us plentiful crops, foundations to build upon, and paths for rivers to flow across. It is through the development of villages, cities, and fortifications in various terrain types that has allowed previous states across the subcontinent to flourish, and that knowledge of how to cultivate the land for both economic growth and defensive positions is what is granted to our own nation today."
cen_ind_fight_to_survive:0 "The Many Edges of Destruction"
cen_ind_fight_to_survive_desc:0 "What is certain about the past eras of the subcontinent is that peace was never destined to last. Whether it was the Gupta Empire fighting against nomadic invaders or the Ghurid invasion along the Ganges River or the Delhi Sultanate conquering southward past Gulbarga, these lands have been the subject of conquest after conquest with Hindu and Muslim states struggling to survive. Our upbringing prior to Bharat was no different, struggling to survive in a maelstrom of various polities vying for dominance across generations. That tenacity, that deep-seated struggle for survival, it still lives within Bharat to this very day."
cen_ind_infrastructure_leads_to_education:0 "Literacy in the Deepest Areas"
cen_ind_infrastructure_leads_to_education_desc:0 "Whilst we marvel at great cities like Delhi and Cuttack, we have other villages and towns completely shrouded in mystery due to them being so isolated in jungles and forests. Yet, our development of the land has revealed a great many of these previously isolated communities, and our introduction of innovations in city building has led to rising amounts of literacy across the nation. Promoting the building of schools and libraries even in the deepest and most isolated areas of Bharat will serve to strengthen the administration far into the future and bear out new innovations later on."
cen_ind_without_absolute_authority:0 "Consultation with Others"
cen_ind_without_absolute_authority_desc:0 "Absolute authority in Bharat is an impossibility, dictated by the facts other empires that came before us on the subcontinent knew all too well. Ranging from several different people groups to various religious sects scattered throughout and even just handling the geographic challenges alone for communication, it all makes for a nation that needs to gover by several tiers of administrative processes. Much like how several familial groups in Bharat see the family unit as part of a larger whole, so to will these tiers of administration be part of the larger, all encompassing nation itself."

wes_ary_secure_the_westward_routes:0 "Western Trade Routes, Secured"
wes_ary_secure_the_westward_routes_desc:0 "Routes to the Arabian Peninsula, Mesopotamia, and East Africa have been plentiful across the western waters, but they have usually been controlled by petty dynasties stemming from Sindh, Gujarat, and the Deccan. Now that we have secured these lands firmly and let trade centers begin to cultivate a prosperous, undisturbed existence, we can begin the recruitment of foreign and domestic talent for the likes of the Hindustani administration."
wes_ary_irrigation_and_cultivation:0 "Urban Centers of Hindustani Growth"
wes_ary_irrigation_and_cultivation_desc:0 "In places like Delhi, Ujjain, Thatta, Bidar, and Dhaka, cities are growing with such speed that in just a single century, some cities double in population alone. It is staggering how we are able to see such growth in our unified subcontinent, yet we must always be on watch for how we can refine how we develop the infrastructure in these growing cities. Not only this, but looking to how economics change thanks to farmers utilizing new tools and selling to new markets alongside how cities start to change consumption patters will give us new insights into how to manage our own finances."
wes_ary_deccani_subjugation:0 "From Maharashtra to Tamilakam"
wes_ary_deccani_subjugation_desc:0 "From the lands of the Marathi people to the lands of the Tamil people, the Deccan and Tamilakam itself have been hard to conquer and maintain true control over. Hindustan is a thriving state, yes, but it is one with tension as well as the Deccan is home to various people groups that compete with each other and have their own interests and bases of power. If we can concentrate these people groups toward working in our military through a variety of military developments and projects, then we will be able to not only have a fighting force that is high in quality but also plentiful routes for supplies and movement (civilian and military-wise)."
wes_ary_rajputs_in_the_military:0 "Noble and Honored Families, Subservient"
wes_ary_rajputs_in_the_military_desc:0 "It is not in question that there are dozens upon dozens of royal families all across Hindustan. Some lead righteous and noble communities, others lead smaller and secluded lives, but all of them have a stake in Hindustan's health, economically and militarily. Whilst we have largely sorted out how they will pay taxes and bring forth goods like dyes, fruits, and manufactured goods to our vast internal market, we have yet to sort out how they will be contributing to our military. Now is the time to do as such, with a strong system of organized ranks and regiments to go along with these still prominent royals."
wes_ary_build_up_an_ocean_monopoly:0 "Oceanic Domination"
wes_ary_build_up_an_ocean_monopoly_desc:0 "The power of Hindustan is apparent in many places around us, perhaps most of all in the trade routes going by our coasts and sailing across the waters that surround our subcontinent. Extending our reach into these trade routes that are aided by seasonal monsoon weather will only bolster our economy and give us an even better chance at extending Hindustan's influence into places like Sumatra, Java, the Arabian Peninsula, and East Africa."
wes_ary_gates_to_the_iranian_world:0 "At Peace with Iranian Influence"
wes_ary_gates_to_the_iranian_world_desc:0 "Ghazanvids, Ghurids, Bahmanids, Ilyas Shahi, and more; all of these dynasties that have had (or possibly still do have) considerable influence throughout the lands that Hindustan calls its own now. With each new dynasty and especially with the advent of the Delhi Sultanate's rise and collapse, Iranian culture seeped into the various pockets of the subcontinent. Sufis, emirs, and nawabs alike intermixed and played pivotal roles in introducing this wondrous land to various aspects of Iranian culture, and it is in Hindustan that the cultural blending crystallizes into its greatest form."
south_lively_culture_and_festivals:0 "Sing, Dance, and Celebrate!"
south_lively_culture_and_festivals_desc:0 "Across Hindustan we see various celebrations and festivals going on every single year, yet some puritanical and zealous members of our faith insist on cracking down on some of these purely Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist events. We are wise enough to turn these demands down as the wondrous music played and the dances performed ensure that the populace is happy and content to some degree. Perhaps our ruler will even join in on occasion, or personally sponsor some of these colorful events."

south_resource_monopolies:0 "One State to Rule Them All"
south_resource_monopolies_desc:0 "Undoubtedly our control over the southern reaches of the subcontinent has garnered us immense profits from taxation alone, but we also must take into account the resources produced too, like various spices and tropical wood. Working with local Malayalam communities will help ensure that our production quotas are always met and that our hegemony over ocean trade is never in jeopardy."
south_southern_martial_arts:0 "Promoting Martial Arts"
south_southern_martial_arts_desc:0 "Close quarters combat is something well known across the subcontinent, but our main base of power stemming from the southern reaches means that an emphasis on martial arts is certainly present. From the Tamil weapon-based Silambam to the Malayalam Kalaripayattu and more, we will be encouraging the usage of these various combat forms for both recreational purposes and to help harden our military force when they are not on active duty."
south_tamil_respect_in_both_directions:0 "Mutualistic Internal Relations"
south_tamil_respect_in_both_directions_desc:0 "Tamil people are very influential across Hindustan now that it is a unified state. Coastal cities and lively urban centers often have at least a small and noticeable Tamil population in them, and as they continue to spread out and influence our internal politics, we should do our part and give them respect. Hiring Tamil traders, using Tamil soldiers, and integrating the Tamil language as a whole, it is all part of the active internal cooperation Hindustan strives to foster."
south_greater_integration_of_all_faiths:0 "Minority over Hindustan"
south_greater_integration_of_all_faiths_desc:0 "Islam is by no means the majority in Hindustan and it never has been. Hinduism and its many traditions combined with Jainism and Buddhism vastly outdo our faith in terms of number of adherents, yet that has not stopped us from unifying the land under one flag and one administration. Learning from this step-by-step experience on conquering and integrating various communities across the subcontinent has made us keenly aware of how we should and should not reconcile differences between faiths on both the large and small scale."
south_dyes_weaving_and_cloth_making:0 "Weaving Greater Industries"
south_dyes_weaving_and_cloth_making_desc:0 "Hindustan is a grand exporter of dyes, woven clothes, and precious jewels that nobles all across the world would love to have. These outside demands need to be met somehow, or we might be left struggling to compete against our neighbors who are also making leaps to promote their own products on the slowly expanding global market. Investing in new technology that can help our weavers, miners, and farmers get their job done efficiently is exactly what Hindustan needs to secure its place in the globe."
hindu_raise_up_great_monuments:0 "Superior Designs of Prestige"
hindu_raise_up_great_monuments_desc:0 "From Delhi to Kannauj, and from Chittor to Bidar, monuments are scattered across the subcontinent just waiting to be cultivated even further. Not only this, but new monuments that are both prestigious and functional are waiting to be built by our artisans and engineers. Who are we to stop this march of greatness into the future? And who are we to stop the world from gazing upon our work with amazement?"
hindu_ganges_river_focus:0 "Heart of the Ganges River"
hindu_ganges_river_focus_desc:0 "Bringing fertility to so many stretches of land across the northern part of our nation, the Ganges River is holy to more than just Hindus alone for good reason. By building up more communities around the river itself, promoting proper irrigation of various fertile lands, and building decent roads beside the river itself, we will ensure a consistent stream of food, taxes, and tradable material."
hindu_break_down_barriers_between_religions:0 "Many Minds with Many Truths"
hindu_break_down_barriers_between_religions_desc:0 "The northern part of Hindustan (especially from Delhi to Dhaka and Thatta) has been subjected to a myriad of Muslim rulers over the past centuries, yet before then it was a haven to Hindu rulers alongside Buddhist and Jain folks who were widely influential on politics. These seismic shifts in power across the ages has yielded a plethora of outcomes, though we have benefited from the theological and philosophical one mostly. Breaking down the barriers between these religious traditions is perhaps one of the greatest gifts upon Hindustan itself."
hindu_professional_upcoming_military:0 "Higher Standards for Hindustan"
hindu_professional_upcoming_military_desc:0 "Gunpowder is a good resource for our military to use, but in an unorganized and decentralized military force, gunpowder won't do much of anything. What Hindustan needs is to refine how its weaponry are made, how they are distributed, and most importantly to us going forward, how they are used in battle. It is not going to be easy getting thousands of recruits to know how to handle, clean, reload, and fire a musket properly, but Hindustan will drill them into knowing allof it better than any other military around the world."
hindu_militant_punjabi_communities:0 "Rein in Militant Communities"
hindu_militant_punjabi_communities_desc:0 "The rise of a centralized military structure and a more adept administration across Hindustan is seen by many as a good thing, but some communities of people wish to retain autonomy in various ways. Instead of cracking down on these communities of people (who can and have fought back against our attempts to rein them in), we should be striving to work with them and making compromises. For example, they can serve in the Hindustani military sector in exchange for increased local autonomy... For now."
hindu_unparalleled_urban_expansion:0 "Unrivaled Urban Expansion"
hindu_unparalleled_urban_expansion_desc:0 "Our policies regarding taxation, constructing functional buildings inside growing cities, and simply having a degree of peace settle across the landscape has resulted in an unprecedented growth in the size of urban centers. Though this growth is causing tensions with regards to housing and the growth of the merchant class itself, we cannot deny the benefits we have gained so far."
hindu_northern_and_southern_hindustan:0 "Logistics of the Subcontinent"
hindu_northern_and_southern_hindustan_desc:0 "Getting troops, supplies, money, even animals for farms and markets across the subcontinent has proven to be difficult over the past centuries. Roads are often of varied quality and dirt paths are often the norm instead of gravel or stone roads that are easier for everyone to move across. The time has come for drastic changes if we are to rectify the logistical situation of Hindustan; in the future, we will be able to supply our military and our cities with ample grain and materials thanks to our emphasis on solid road networks."
east_ary_emphasize_the_bengal_delta:0 "The World around the Delta"
east_ary_emphasize_the_bengal_delta_desc:0 "The Bengal Delta is truly a magnificent gift for the people of Hindustan, both great and small. All of our nation benefits from the trade going on in the Bengal Delta as we do business with merchants from Java, Japan, Arabia, and also East Africa. By reinforcing our focus on the Bengal Delta over time and building more harbors as well as docks to service the incoming merchants from abroad, we will emphasize our position as a true trade hub on the world stage."
east_ary_lessons_of_nepal:0 "Lessons in the Mountains"
east_ary_lessons_of_nepal_desc:0 "Going through and conquering the various parts of the Himalayas that are inhabited by various Nepali people has been trying to say the least. Attrition and infantry-oriented tactics make for a much different playing field, one that has instilled into Hindustan mindset keen on its infantry as the source of military power, and effective siege equipment to deal with dug in defenders."
east_ary_the_growth_of_new_religions:0 "Religious Movements in Hindustan"
east_ary_the_growth_of_new_religions_desc:0 "Whilst Hindustan changes throughout its life to face new challenges internally and externally, we must never let our guard down when it comes to the growth of theological challenges too. We are seeing the slow rise of new religious sects and movements in both Hindu and Islamic sectors, but are they truly threats that need military action? The zealous among us say yes, but we are more understanding than they are thanks to our own roots prior to becoming Hindustan; let us speak with these new religious movements and come to terms with them instead of provoking them into conflict."
east_ary_respect_the_school_of_elders:0 "The School of Elders, Respected"

Though it has several tenets that a mufti or imam of ours would fine strange, the School of Elders shouldn't be shunned in the slightest in Hindustan, for it is this very land we call our home from which the original form of Buddhism arose from and flourished. Respecting the scholars, ascetics, and proponents of Theravada Buddhism will garner us more loyalty amongst citizens and also greater insight into theological issues."

east_ary_improve_upon_gajapati_organization_desc:0 "The apex of Oriya power prior to us was that of the Gajapati Empire. A complex and militaristic empire that stretched along the eastern coast, its downfall should not mean Hindustan cannot learn from what happened in its past. The military organization of the Gajapati Empire is one we could actually attempt to improve upon as it had thoroughly defined divisions to work with. If Hindustan can improve upon what was done in the past, it will seem familiar but perform better to those who are used to the old way of things and grant us a greater amount of flexibility militarily."

east_ary_brahmaputra_and_ganges_authority_desc:0 "The two main northern rivers by which the Hindustan economy relies upon are the Ganges and the Brahmaputra River, but the Indus River is vital as well despite it only feeding a smaller section of land. What the first two rivers do for us though is undeniable: they feed into the Bengal Delta and provide immense amount of productive potential in the land all along its banks. This means that if we can adapt the usage of various technologies to the wetter conditions of the Bhramaputra as we have done with the Ganges, then we will be an unstoppable economic force on the world stage."
east_ary_cultural_caste_systems:0 "Knowing the Many Castes"
east_ary_cultural_caste_systems_desc:0 "Throughout Hindustan, there are several versions of what is commonly known to outsiders as the 'caste system'. It is not a 'one size fits all' system when one looks at various communities around the subcontinent with increased focus as certain castes may change in what they do from one region or another, or change in how they are represented from one culture to another. If Hindustan is to sustain a stable adminsitration from the top down, it must look into the castes and not break them down, but rather catalogue and work with them."

cen_ind_more_than_just_blending_in_desc:0 "If one simply takes the Quran and puts it side-by-side next to the Vedas, there is going to be several concepts and ideas in conflict, no? In that same vein, if we were to put the laws dictated by Islam next to the laws dictated by the traditions of the subcontinent and all its diverse people groups, there would be conflicts without end in Hindustan! That is why we have adjusted our laws so heavily to compromise and craft a more stable state, one that cares much less about the actual religion of an advisor or merchant and more so about the inner qualities of the person in question."

cen_ind_the_good_will_of_sufis_desc:0 "Since our upbringing as a Muslim minority ruling over a Hindu majority, the sufis of our nation have done work in so many fields that we would be a dead state without them. Sponsoring more to come in from the lands of Iran and Arabia will only help Hindustan flourish far into the future, and they will also continue to help bridge the gap between Hindu, Jain, Buddhist, and Muslim communities."

cen_ind_mastery_of_ruling_through_others_desc:0 "One perk we have gained from our upbringing is that of knowing just how to rule through other administrators such as viziers, emirs, nawabs, and even rajas. Governing the scattered lands of Hindustan is by no means an easy task for any ruler, but these various advisors and courtiers help see to it that even the communities in the furthest reaches such as those of the Garjat Hills and the Thar Desert are never out of our reach."

cen_ind_rework_revenue_streams_desc:0 "Rebellious sentiment can easily build up in Hindustan if our administration is too relaxed on how it conducts simple things like collecting taxes or conducting trade, which is why we should take the time to carefully examine how we are doing both in with our most rural provincial officials. Refining these parts of our administration especially will help keep rebellious sentiment in check and also keep our revenue in order for the future."

Our fortifications will tower over the land yet be positioned in such a way that they make the enemy suffer much more during long sieges. Our cities as well will eventually be ordered in such a way that civilians and military personnel are able to move through with ease thanks to paved roads, proper drainage, and well taken care of logistics."

cen_ind_firearms_of_the_tropics_desc:0 "One thing that has plagued gunpowder weapons in Hindustan for generations now is the humidity and the rain; they just won't work if things are too wet! That is why our engineers have been out in the tropical areas where the Gondi and Jharkhandi people live, testing new devices and designs that mitigate this problem somewhat. These new firearms are not the greatest and perhaps only have limited usage in certain wet conditions, but they will give an advantage if we distribute them properly and train enough troops with them."

cen_ind_pragmatism_over_zealotry_desc:0 "If there is one word that sums up how Hindustan handles much of its politics, it is this: pragmatism. Handling so many things in a realistic sense rather than a perhaps religious or militaristic sense has granted Hindustan many perks and favors over the years, and it is because of this pragmatic attitude that we are able to do without things like building restrictions on certain religious communities or militarization of certain areas that are better suited for other purposes. We are a sensible nation, looking to do sensible things internally with our own people."

The bridges required to cross the Loire River are not plentiful and because of this, only a few cities across France have been able to propser besides the Loire River.

Her efforts and her memory last on in Orleans to this very day and veneration of her is not uncommon throughout the city and its rural areas.

Orleans was affected by this as well, unfortunately, but the rebound we are experiencing now is something we should be focused on! Farming is on the rise, structures in the city center are coming together, and most importantly, saffron is being grown once more. Such a delectable spice being resurgent in Orleans is sure to attract hungry merchants from across Europe!"

They were eccentric and unique clothing styles compared to other chatelains throughout French lands and they can often times be found idly chatting about the latest trends in what other nobles and royals are wearing. It may be a meaningless subject to peasants or soldiers, but to courtiers and royalty, being of high prestige and uniquely good appearance helps make for good relations."

invigoration_in_our_university_desc:0 "Established with the oversight of Pope Clement V in 1306, the University of Orleans has been a central facet of our growth as a city and more recently, as a state within French lands vying for power and influence. Though the Catholic Church may look down on us for hosting theological and philosophical debates regarding a myriad of topics, we will not stand in the way of progress when it comes to exploring new ideas. The university is where these ideas will be tested with rigor so that only the best ones are used in the administration of Orleans."

Increasingly we are seen as an integral part of the idea of 'France' on a political map and as a concept to strive; if claimants to the French throne do not have influence or ties with Orleans, they are likely to be on unstable ground if and when they ascend to the throne itself. We should use this amount of influence we have wisely, for every step we take in diplomacy and politics is noted by royals not just in French lands, but in English, German, Italian, and even Iberian lands."

These attempts at gaining power do include raiding and intruding on what is rightfully territory of the Ming Dynasty, meaning that we have had to double up our fortification efforts along the Great Wall.

We should work to have two standards in place since our core populace of Han Chinese are often times living with or nearby these minority communities: one set of standards for those of Han Chinese classification, and another set of standards for those of non-Han Chinese classification (with further sub-divisions of laws for various minorities given the exact region/area)."

Now that things have stabilized and the Ming Dynasty has solidified its place in the world, we can work on commissioning new texts around philosophy, metaphysics, administration, astronomy, agriculture, mathematics, and more. The texts will undoubtedly serve to promote our wealth and grandeur whilst also spreading innovative ideas around our realm."

dealing_with_multi_ethnic_and_corrupt_armies_desc:0 "It is not secret that in the lands of the Ming Dynasty, being in the military is looked down upon by the rest of society. It isn't prestigious nor noble like some foreigners would normally think since most soldiers are illiterate and not under the command of civil officials, leading to immense corruption at times; this can be further amplified by the multi-ethnic status of our military. What we must do is work toward educating parts of the military and in essence giving it a slightly higher place in society. A healthy dose of civil authority and measures to shed some light on this shady sector of the Ming Dynasty will go a long way to improving the overall quality."

Firearms both big and small are making it so that new military divisions are overtaking the old ones, so much so that the new three core divisions are becoming too integral to do without; these three divisions are: Shenjiying (Firearms Division), Wujunying (Five Barracks Battallion), and Sanqianying (Three Thousand Batallion). Transitioning to these divisions fully will take time, but it will ensure that the Ming Dynasty is ready to innovate on its own military for the future."

Often times our own people have integrated Hindu, Buddhist, or even sometiems Islamic customs into local followings and traditions, meaning that our core set of people know exactly how to deal with outside religious differences. In overcoming these religious differences, Nagpur can and will see a stronger push for a communal work ethic that can bring about great works within towns and cities."

Instead what we see skirmishes and sieges shorter in length alongside the raiding of villages and towns for resources; at times, successful raids could even turn into conquests. We of Nagpur carry forth this tradition into the future as we focus more on mobility for raiding and striking at the enemy when they least expect it; if these tactics also yield bountiful plunder for our treasury, that is merely icing on the cake."

The death of Lan Kham Daeng ushered in a period of strife so great that few nobles and monks could tell who was actually the ruler of Lan Xang; even Vientiane revolted against the fractured administration. Thankfully we have stamped out the flames of anarchy from back then and are well on our way to establishing Lan Xang's dominance across all internal domains. The next time regicide and revolt are threatened against Lan Xang, we will be far more prepared."

There are times where we will need to enforce our mandala over the others surrounding Lan Xang and assert proper authority over places ruled by Vietnamese, Khmer, Thai, and even Burmese people alike. If we can get these various people groups around us to recognize the central mandala established by Fa Ngum in 1357, they will be all the more willing to serve us through tribute and service."

It's symbolism is not lost on any peasant, monk, or noble of our land that sees it, for it has been with us since the inception of Lan Xang itself by Fa Ngum. With it safely in Luang Prabang, it is seen as a sign generally as the right to rule over Lan Xang as only a venerable and virtuous ruler and their administration may be the caretaker of such a sacred image.

Lao people from lower classes are picking up manuscripts and attempting to read them whilst those fortunate enough to have the capability are trying to integrate writing into their daily lives. It is here that we can improve on the religious foundation of Lan Xang by translating the old Buddhist texts like the Tripitaka from Sanskrit or Pali into Lao.

We should not try to openly convert these communities in the hills as they can easily become unreachable havens of rebel sentiment.

We do not let petty sons fight over the throne with various armies assembled across the state for that only leads to horrible civil wars.

It's becoming more and more prominent in Dai Viet as time goes on and we are seeing the fruits of this come about in our administration. Less Buddhist temples (like pagodas) are being built and fewer pieces of land are being granted to Buddhists in general, whereas we are seeing a stronger emphasis on education through helping people learn to read and write before studying regular subjects like mathematics or geography."

Thankfully though, it is due to our policies and efforts on all fronts that our own people are once more reaching out into the artistic world to explore what they can do once again. Artistic forms like hat tuong (a form of Vietnamese opera), cheo (a form of satirical musical theatre), and ca tru (a form of musical storytelling done by a female vocalist) are all being attempted and refined in more than just a few towns and cities.

Though small in scope, it set a precedent going forward to continue having Confucian-like examiniations so that the administration of Dai Viet could have a strong set of educated officials to work with. As we grow as a state with more aspects to worry about, we will need to expand these examinations over time to encompass more towns and more provinces.

The worst of it was perhaps the Fall of Angkor in 1431 wherein Ponhea Yat fled and had to establish a new capital at Phnom Penh. In these bloody and sorrowful memories of our past, there is a solid notion that we should take to heart: Khmer people and those of the state itself will never give in to the enemy no matter how bad it gets.

Our past rulers recognized this after the transition from Hinduism to Buddhism in the middle of the 1300s and with that transition came the fall of the idea that our ruler was a god-king, or, a devaraja. In doing this, our rulers are more human than some others around us; they can relate to the common people more so and are more humble than surrounding rulers most of the time. In continuing this more human view of the ruler, we will ensure a more concrete connection to the Khmer people."

The Lao of Lan Xang actively attempt to hinder our trade efforts downstream through incursions and backroom deals, yet we still control the southern part of the Mekong River which is most vital. If we can continue to capitalize on our core region of the Mekon River and promote growth around it via markets and safe villages, we will be able to claw back what power was taken from us by Lan Xang."

Though there are periods of time when it is dry enough to use firearms, we know that these are few and far between when compared to places like the Indian Subcontinent or mainland China.

They could not do it before and they will not do it anytime soon as we are growing stronger than ever before thanks to our recent efforts.

temporal_spiritual_imam_authority_desc:0 "Ibadi Islam has a fiery history that dates all the way back to the Muhakkima, one of the supporters  of Ali in the First Fitna (though they later revoked this support). Ibn Ibad's teachings that were developed later by Jabir ibn Zayd helped form the theological basis by which the first Ibadi state would be established in Hadhramaut, but after it failed during the Umayyad Caliphate, Ibadi teachings settled in Oman in the mid to late 700s. Part of the basis for Ibadi Islam that is quite different from other branches is that the imam that leads the people (and has control over spiritual and temporal matters) is to be elected, not divinely chosen. Granted this is not easy to do for Oman today, we do try to stick to the initial and guiding teachings of Ibadi Islam."

The Mamluks started to do things differently, however, and they began to involve us more and more into politics outside of our traditional home territory, meaning we are coming into contact with a great deal of foreign states our ancestors could only dream of. As both positive and negative attention comes toward the Hejaz area, we must seek out more determined defenders of the holy cities, those driven to keep unwanted invaders from encroaching into our lands as our influence slowly begins to spread."

We are of sayyid blood as it is and the old Fatimid Caliphate is long gone alongside the Abbasid Caliphate, meaning the position is effectively vacant for now.

Despite all of the revolts, devolutions of central power, and invasions from foreign powers like the Bohemians and the Mongols, the Polish state survived in some distinct form.

We must not get in the way of this urban progression if we are to keep our place on the world stage; we should be encouraging these new industries as much as we can!"

maintain_an_internal_focus_desc:0 "We may think that someday the Deccan will be a stable, sustainable state that will have very little issues running on its own with little guidance from the royal family, but this notion is entirely untrue. A state is never 'finished' in any sense; the empires and states of the past, like the Gupta Empire or the Rashtrakuta Dynasty, are clear examples of this. Thus, if we are to continue to be successful as a state governing the beating heart of the subcontinent, we must never take our eyes off the internal matters that consistently shift around from day to day, week to week, and month to month. Answers to our problems lay not beyond our borders, but rather they lay inside, like a puzzle that is never quite solved."

reformation_of_roman_provinces_desc:0 "The borders of past Roman provinces (both imperial and senatorial ones) were lacking in their administrative strategy as it disregarded geography and the people groups living in various places, meaning internal tensions in various provinces could easily break out and the bureaucracy would struggle to handle it. We can remake these provinces alongside actual geographic and cultural lines though since we have a much more in-depth understanding of the land than our ancestors did."

adaptable_legions_reborn_desc:0 "Is there anything more iconic about our ancestors than the legions themselves? Truly they were a marvel for their time, but they were vulnerable to corruption and lapses in training due to how big the old empire was in conjunction with how autonomous legions could be. If we are to bring back the notion of legions within our own military today, we must take steps to centralize the military as a whole whilst also ensuring that our soldiers and commanders are ready for whatever threat comes their way."

Some of these structures have been repurposed for modern usage whilst others have been left to be reclaimed by nature itself, but the fact that there is so much still around is a testament to just how impactful our ancestors were with buildings alone. By using modern materials and logistics in conjunction with old Roman stylings, we can ensure our buildings are both glorious and functional in more ways than one."

efficient_engineering_desc:0 "Few would ever doubt the ingenious engineering that the Roman Empire conducted throughout its time before being fractured. From bridges to aqueducts to siege weapons and more, our ancestors were true masters of engineering for their time period and it is up to us to live up that legacy. Through the construction of new structures that are meant for both civilian and military use, we will refine our artisans and engineers over time so that they can serve both economic and militaristic purposes."

This made it so that there was a clear seperation between how non-citizens and citizens though there was a slow process of 'Romanization' through the prospect of becoming a citizen over time. If we can reform this process and bring it under a sense of control throughout the entire empire as it stands today, we will be able to bring in more people to contribute to the economy and the military."

From the times of Otto I to Frederick I and beyond, there has been very little peace in Central Europe despite the Holy Roman Empire on paper being able to resolve such conflicts, but that time is now officially over. Now we look to a new era, an era where Central Europe has a uniform military, administration, and trade sector that cannot be matched by the French, the English, nor the Italians or Iberians. Truly there will be none that can match us going forward."

If there is one thing a unified Holy Roman Empire can work on first in the area of militarism, it is the logistics sector as we have plenty of roads to compound upon and also a plethora of fighting men ready to be organized into a cohesive set of regiments."

To ensure that such an administration can handle the various matters that states like Austria, Saxony, or Bohemia struggled with is no small feat; our court has grown to encompass a huge amount of officials that few other courts would be able to compare to.

Whether they were Muslims or Catholics, French of Castilian, or any other sort of contender for power in the region, they were routinely in contest for our land at some point.

He switched sides at multiple points and attempted to further his own ambitions by playing to one side or the other in the war, though his ambitions were left unfulfilled in the end. It would be good for us to embody the more diplomatic side of Charles II's reign instead of his more cruel side since we could certainly use more connections and agents in foreign cities to inform us who we should fight for."

Formed initially under Charles II to go against Charles V of France, they were eventually organized to go eastward in the 1370s after the earnest recruiting efforts of Enguerrand VII of Coucy. With lances, mounted archers, and engineers at the ready, they performed very well as a mercenary company in the lands of the crumbling Byzantine Empire up until the 1380s. Their legacy rings through the streets of Navarra still to this very day in the mercenary contracts we take up and in the engineers we hire for both military and civilian uses."

Though some would see this as an excuse to crack down on them, we know that we can use these nobles and their entrenched identities to our advantage should we be on good terms with them. They can be very valuable informants for our administration should foreign powers be trying to make moves against us."

re_establish_royal_authority_desc:0 "Though the War of the Bands is well and truly over, royal authority is still lacking in some of the more rural parts of our state due to the fact that the previously autonomous nobility were able to build their own quarters away from the peering eyes of our administration. We shoudl work to enlist more loyal officials and steadily expand our court in size in accordance with our expanding economy so that we can keep better track of these more rural areas; royal authority cannot and will not be evaded."

This has led to a concept of 'Frisian Freedom' wherein governance is fairly decentralized and horizontal in its governing structure; there have been few if any families of great power akin to the nobles of the rest of Europe. We have not been able to stave off the advancing tide of feudalism forever, however, and it consistently encroaches on Frisian lands like the tide of the sea, but it is not unstoppable! We must never forget what freedom our ancestors had and we must always be ready to fight for it!"

The Vetkopers and Schieringers are the prime suspects here and have stoked the flames of ongoing internal feuds and outright civil wars across the lands of Frisia (both in Friesland and East Frisia). Outside forces have sought to take advantage of the factionalism by allying with one faction or the other, yet this has proven to be unsuccessful time and time again as the other faction comes back in time when they are given the opportunity.

There has been one potestaat elected to lead Friesland (Juw Juwinga in 1396 by the Schieringers), but this did not stop the process of local potestaats from being elected afterwards, thus carrying forth the notion of a very horizontal governing structure. If we are to survive as an independent polity that respects its own people and traditions, we would do well to uphold the notion of potestaats for our state."

Despite Arnulf's attempt to proclaim himself as count of Oostergo and Westergo, the Frisians he did battle with resisted courageously and killed him in battle. With his death, Frisian Freedom can be said to have been secured for the first time.

Once we have a solid grasp on who will bein our administration and how we will direct the legislative processes, we will be able to utilize these sources of revenue and popular support for our own purposes.

They poison the politics of the Papal States for their own selfish desires which can be seen when the Counts of Tusculum ran the Papacy like a puppet on strings from the 900s to the 1000s. Those of Tusculum were arbiters of politics and religion in Rome, held several powerful positions in and around Rome itself, and even had a successor family that was almost as powerful as they were: the Colonna family.

By having shareholders buy different amounts of 'stock' in a certain trade company, there is less risk overall since investors are not putting all of their money in one endeavor, yet the company still gets great amounts of funding for whatever it needs.

absorbing_orders_smaller_than_us_desc:0 "The Knights Templar were persecuted and cut down in the early 1300s, something that shook the order members of the time to their very core; if they could be disolved by force so easily in a world of Catholics, what would keep the Teutonic Order alive? Well having solid amounts of land to fall back upon is the first step, and one fo the later steps is integrating other smaller holy orders into the wider Teutonic Order as a whole. We did this with the Livonian Order to the north some time ago so there is precedent to follow."

Muskets can penetrate the thickest of plates we have, and what happens when our righteous knights finally get up close to the enemy? They are heavily outnumbered and are potentially one fair musket shot away from dying! Truly we are in a new age of warfare and strategy; these future battles will be decided not by pure martial prowess alone and we must integrate this idea firmly into the Teutonic Order."

Upon its completion, celebrations were had and it was set forth that Gandzasar Monastery would be the residence of the Catholicois of Albania within the wider Armenian Apostolic Church. So long as it stands tall in the lands of Armenia, we can be sure that faithful Apostolic followers both near and far will rally to our banners in times of need and help preserve the faith that has been at the core of Armenia for several centuries."

His own cousin helped carry on his legacy as well through ruling with the surname Avanyan over the territory of Dizak. To top it all off, part of Hasan-Jalal's lineage remains as the head of the Catholicos of Albania, showing just how influential and ingrained into Armenian institutions they truly are. Should all these parts of Hasan-Jalal's legacy move and act in unison, the respect and loyalty from the people will be immense."

What can easily unite them together though is a common enemy or a common cause and it is through these measures that we will seek to unify them into one cohesive state over time. It won't be easy as they are reluctant to give up such traditional autonomy, but integrating them and their righteous troops into a greater Armenian army will help bolster our overall strength."

Trying to crack the fortifications erected on high hills and near jagged mountain passes has proven to be deathly for countless leaders, meaning that naturally there is more autonomy given to the region as a whole. Armenian people have thus remained fairly well off in terms of having to adhere to foreign laws and customs; we will capitalize on this over time by knowing every pathway in and out of the mountains and also keeping our own finances in order before listening to foreign tax collectors.

What we must focus on as a state native to these mountain passes and tough fortifications is developing the logistics that supply them. Fresh water, resources like timber, stone, and iron, and capable soldiers are just some of the things needed for Armenian fortifications like the one at Khokhanaberd, and we will ensure that they have everything they need given enough time."

Even in Armenian cities and towns there are several Muslim communities that live and work beside our own brothers and sisters in faith, so why should be try to cut these Muslims out of our state or any of our societies? Simply put, we should not do as such. Instead, we should be looking toward utilizing what Muslim connections we have in Armenian communities so that we can reach out and befried Islamic courts just as we do Christian ones.

The initial split between the two sees came about because of frequent changes to the headquarters of the church itself; Armenian polities of the past were not the most stable as many people have recorded. Since we are looking to a brighter future, however, we should certainly look into establishing new sees with their own catholicos that are subordinate to the 'Catholicos of All Armenians' stationed in Etchmiadzin.

And yet, the House of Valois-Burgundy started by Philip the Bold has risen above the other French dukes and counts to carve out a large realm of its own, though dynastically still tied to the House of Valois of course.

Several times there have been noble revolts that sought to force the king to retract some reforms or laws that would disempower said nobles; there was one even one in 1440 that Philip the Good of Burgundy supported.

We of Burgundy must be ready to shift our funding around when the time is right to reform the military on multiple levels so that we are never caught lagging behind on the field of battle. New gunpowder weapons both big and small, recruiting officers more so by merit rather than noble blood, and looking into the tactics of those around us so that we might be able to improve; these are just a few ways in which Burgundian forces will be adapting to the changing times."

strengthen_austrian_religious_ties_desc:0 "Though traditionally Catholic, we of Austria cannot deny that the fluctuations in religion across Europe thanks to the Protestant Reformation are concerning at the very least. Princes, bishops, and even whole royal families are turning against each other due to the rifts in Catholicism that are being opened up, yet we of Austria know that this is no time to be fickle with religious matters. We must choose a side and stick with it no matter what! And if this means that heathens get expelled for being caught in the middle, then so be it!"
bring_together_varied_strategies:0 "An Austrian Trove of Strategies"
bring_together_varied_strategies_desc:0 "The various strategies at the disposal of the Austrian military is diverse as it is. Our authority over not just Austria as a whole but over various other states and populations means that we have regiments that can specialize in a number of fields: sieges, logistics, skirmishing, cavalry charges, retreating, and the list goes on from there. It is our task as the main organizer of these regiments to try to incorporate these various specialties into one cohesive military force that can rival the likes of the Ottomans or the French."
solidify_austrian_finances:0 "Integrate the Banking Families"
solidify_austrian_finances_desc:0 "The lands of Austria are full of wealth, but it is not always home grown wealth since Austria itself isn't full of minerals or crops that can make it endless amounts of money. More often than not, Austrian royalty has come to rely on banking families in nearby states for funding in both internal and external matters. Exerting a greater influence over these banking families and their estates through dynastic or political moves will help bind said families to Austria as a whole, thus granting the state a more secure economic structure."

establish_the_turkish_language_officially_desc:0 "Mehmet I of Karaman, a minor figure to those outside of Karaman but within our borders and our administration, his work has been greatly influential. His firman issued in May of 1277 that advocated for the Turkish language to be used in official positions instead of Arabid of Farsi was the first of its kind, and it is something that we hold to closely to this day. The ulema may still prefer Arabic or Farsi to this day, but the likes of Karaman's royalty both near and far will learn Turkish as their first language."

relentless_back_and_forths_desc:0 "Whether it is changing borders with the Sultanate of Rum or switching the borders with other beyliks or even trading blows with the House of Osman, we of Karaman have endured for several generations in Anatolia. It has not been easy by any means as our heartland has been stuck down by enemy invasions over and over again, but we are nothing if not resourceful in the face of an oncoming storm."
bolstering_karaman_ranks:0 "Integrated Regiments"
bolstering_karaman_ranks_desc:0 "Support from external powers like the Mamlukes of Egypt has been common, yet Karaman has not always been able to rely on just one source of foreign fighters. Mercenary regiments that are common to see in Karaman and other parts of Anatolia are not only capable of sticking it out through thick and thin, they are also disciplined enough to fight in tandem with Karaman's own soldiers."
not_afraid_to_raze_cities:0 "Ready to Raze"
not_afraid_to_raze_cities_desc:0 "The towns and cities of Anatolia are no stranger to exchanging hands between beyliks and sultans. Some are benevolent and allow the populace to live in peace when they are conquered, but others are caught in the blazing inferno of war and suffer great amounts of casualties. We of Karaman have taken part in this razing of civilian settlements when needed so as to make a point to our enemies; they will have no mercy, no quarter, and no sympathy in our land. Their valuable resources can be better used by those loyal to the administration of Karaman."
ready_sources_of_karaman_fighters:0 "Recruit from the Outskirts"
ready_sources_of_karaman_fighters_desc:0 "Whilst we have full control of the more urbanized centers of Karaman, the outskirts of our territory have villages that are full of valuable fighters. We can recruit these capable soldiers if we incentivize them enough with a common enemy or perhaps materials like weaponry, food, or perhaps even compromises on local laws. Some would call this 'scraping the bottom of the barrel', yet instead we think of it as using every part of our state to its fullest potential."

secure_our_aesthetic_legacy_desc:0 "Whether they are mosques, baths, caravanserais, or madrasas, the beauty of Karaman's architecture is starting to be noticed by outsiders. Merchants, artists, and engineers alike are slowly arriving to gaze upon and take notes on how we impart beauty onto functional structures. Who are we to deny such marvelous and functional structures from being built more and more around Karaman?"
from_the_candar_corps_on_up:0 "Roots in the Candar Corps"
from_the_candar_corps_on_up_desc:0 "Candar corps are something of a class of soldiers that are common in most Muslim states stretching from Anatolia to the lands of the Iranians, yet there are very few instances where they are able to truly make a name for themselves. Our roots, however, are from these very soldiers as our founder, Demir Yaman Candar, was the founder of our beylik around the year 1292. It is his legacy of the candar corps that we still hold to this day as regal and stalwart soldiers, ready to fight to the death for Candar as a whole."

with_autonomy_comes_candarid_development_desc:0 "The rise of the House of Osman came with the demise of several surrounding beyliks and their independent development of architecture and culture, but still some hold out against their rising power. We are one such beylik as we have been able to rely on our strong cities and coastal connections to develop a more robust adminstration and cohesive military. Keeping the core of Candar safe from harm will only grant us greater developments that the House of Osman could only dream of."
mercantile_matters_of_sinop:0 "Trading in Sinop"
mercantile_matters_of_sinop_desc:0 "Sinop has been a trade hub for well over a few generations at this point and we are not keen on seeing that trade dwindle. We don't care much for what religion the traders are, just so long as they make fair and lucrative deals with our merchants. Some might then ask about the descent of these merchants; are they Genoese or Georgian? Turkic or Greek? That does not matter either in Sinop; what matters is that profits are gained."
kastamonu_mineral_wealth:0 "Mining in Kastamonu"
kastamonu_mineral_wealth_desc:0 "Kastamonu is not like Sinop in the sense that it attracts lucrative trade deals, but Kastamonu does have what Sinop does not: mineral wealth! Copper and iron mined from Kastamonu means that we are attracting more and more engineers and workers for workshops and foundries, which means we should be investing more resources into ensuring that the mines themselves are productive in the future. If we can maintain a degree of economic independence from our neighbors, Candar will be one step closer to greatness."
capable_ship_production_at_sinop:0 "Cultivate Sinop's Potential"
capable_ship_production_at_sinop_desc:0 "Through Sinop, we see a future of great potential. A grandiose administration, a strong military force, and a prominent navy that can go toe-to-toe with other fleets in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. In order to fulfill the naval part of things though, we must ensure that the shipyards of Sinop are expanded as time goes on. Larger and more innovative ship designs are going to require more space to be worked on, which means Candar itself should be investing into the expansion of Sinop's coastal front."
as_quick_as_can_be_in_anatolia:0 "As Quick as Cavalry"
as_quick_as_can_be_in_anatolia_desc:0 "Our Turkic ancestors maintained a much larger and perhaps less disciplined force of cavalry for what they needed, but we of Candar live in a newer age that focuses on multiple aspects of military matters. Though we value infantry and artillery to a fair degree, we still remember some of the key facets that our ancestors focused on with the most prominent being that the military must be quick on its feet. Though our military cannot be as fast as a cavalry army at full pace, we can strive for such speed through clear communication and proper scouting the terrain ahead of our armies."
militancy_from_the_very_start:0 "Born in the Military, Raised by it"
militancy_from_the_very_start_desc:0 "The start of our state was during the tumultuous period of the mid-1200s wherein as-Salih Ayyub's death in 1249 initiated a series of political and military moves that ended with Rukn ad-Din Baybars founding the Bahri Dynasty, thus overthrowing the old dynasty completely. New reforms were put into place that reflected just how militant the new state was going to be, and to this day we embody such militancy throughout our entire state. Mamluks are just as integral to the state today as they were during the reign of Rukn ad-Din Baybars, though there is certainly room for refinement here and there."
reinforce_the_barid:0 "The Barid of Rukn al-Din Baybars"
reinforce_the_barid_desc:0 "Being a sort of state-run courier service, the barid has been around in several Islamic states throughout history so far. It helps facilitate communication between various administrations and also helps ease the burden on government officials when actions need to be carried out with haste. The barid created by Rukn ad-Din Baybars for our sultanate in the 1200s is still in use today, though it could certainly use refinement as the division of power between positions like ustadar, hajib, and atabeg al-askar has changed over time."
build_for_the_public_at_large:0 "Actions, Not Words"
build_for_the_public_at_large_desc:0 "There is a history of attempting to build trust in various sectors of the Mamluk Sultanate through building various structures. Whilst madrasas and mosques are fine for the pious folks of our land, more general infrastructure like functional houses and hospitals are much more genuine actions that the public as a whole can appreciate. If we put serious effort toward such constructions like how Qalawun as-Salihi did, not only will our legacy be etched into the earth, but our people will rally behind us more and more."
start_to_recruit_from_our_own_again:0 "Integrate Ourselves into Egypt"
start_to_recruit_from_our_own_again_desc:0 "The times of Nasir ad-Din Muhammad (three separate reigns as sultan) were turbulent to say the least, but they gave the sultanate a vision of what it could be in the future if the notion of mamluk soldiers were to be questioned. During his third reign (1310-1341), he relaxed the 'entry requirements' of becoming a mamluk in general so that more recruits would flock to the banners of the sultanate over time. Such a way of obtaining capable soldiers may open the doors to Arabs and Egyptians from our heartland to even join the ranks of mamluk soldiers given enough time, thus further integrating ourselves to both external and internal communities."
enforce_state_monopolies_once_more:0 "One Sultan to Rule it All"
enforce_state_monopolies_once_more_desc:0 "Sultan Sayf ad-Din Barsbay initiated a process of monopolization over the spice trade in our land and to this day this is still an ongoing process; civilian merchants are apparently not very keen on giving up what power they have to state-backed merchants. As it continues to happen over time though, we will see our profits rise and our enemies being forced to come to the negotiating table if they want more valuable spices for their various uses."
trust_within_the_administration_again:0 "Restoration of Militant Trust"
trust_within_the_administration_again_desc:0 "Stability has been something that the Mamluk Sultanate struggled to obtain in previous generations due to factional conflict and dynastic intrigue, yet that has not stopped future sultans from trying to remedy what was wrong. We have learned from so many periods of hardship in the past, whether it was the off-and-on reign of Nasir ad-Din Muhammad of the late 1200s or the incidents that caused Upper Egypt to be essentially independent from 1401 to 1413, that we must constantly be on the lookout for ways to improve our administration and also ways to facilitate a smooth succession of power. Such foundations of power in the sultanate must never be in crisis like before if we wish to keep everything together."

Ever since then, the Mamluk Sultanate has been the defender of the rightful caliphs of the Islamic world at large and in exchange for this protection, the caliphs have certified and recognized most if not all the decisions made by us. With the seal of approval by the caliph for future generations, surely there will be no other defender of Islam like our sultanate."

The house was heated by two kanovye hearths. In extreme cold, the Ulch also used large metal braziers on three legs with burning coals. A characteristic feature of the Ulch winter dwelling is the presence of a "dog table", or uycheu - a low platform on which sled dogs were fed. Summer dwellings were of two types - quadrangular made of poles with gable roofs, covered with bark (daura) and pile letniki (gengga)."

The souls of the dead are put into a temporary shelter made of cloth, called a lachako, where they will remain in the lachako for seven days before being moved to a panyo, a wooden doll where the soul will rest until the final funerary ritual.

inter_lock_administrative_cadres_desc:0 "With the unification of the crowns comes administrative questions and some are tougher to handle than others, but we are not without the will to overcome these obstacles.

industrialization_measures_desc:0 "A new age is coming about, an age of new technologies and ideas that the people of the Angevin Realm are seeing as both dangerous and full of potential. It may be foolish of us to rush into this new age, but the benefits of its industrial techniques and new technologies are simply too good to pass up. Whatever problems come with entering this new age we will deal with, but industrial matters must become a central part of the Angevin Realm."

battles_for_strait_control_desc:0 "Our entrance and indeed the entrance to the once mighty Byzantium is that of the Aegean Sea. Trade routes, invasion routes, and important island bases are found within this great sea, which is exactly why we must muster what naval forces we have in order to control it all. Should our naval efforts fail to secure us the Aegean Sea, the entire empire could fall into the hands of our enemies."

frontier_against_islam_desc:0 "Ever since the Turks invaded through the faulty Byzantine defenses and lackluster Byzantine forces, the entirety of Christendom has been under threat from the east and south. That is where the righteous Catholic nobles from the west come through to correct what was done wrong under the Byzantines, and though our efforts were thwarted in the past by the Empire of Nicaea, our resurgent empire will ensure that the tide of Islam can be pushed back through the dynastic alliances of western Catholics and the stalwart religious vigor imbued within them."

northern_and_southern_threats_desc:0 "Traditional enemies of the old Latin Empire from the 1200s were few in number politically, but they were strong enough to deal harsh blows to the empire over the course of about 60 years. Thus, it is our duty to learn from these old threats and examine how we can deal with new threats on our frontiers since not all Christians will abide by what our demolishing of Byzantine authority nor our growing power in the southeast of Europe."

establishing_formal_latinokratia_desc:0 "Rule of the Latins is what 'Latinokratia' roughly means and it is exactly what the Latin Empire will put into place as time goes on. Whilst we do appreciate what the old Byzantine administration did, Catholic rule necessitates Catholic changes across the entire spectrum of administrative matters. And considering that our legacy of crusading has an inherent military tint to it, securing more authority across our empire will be easier as time goes on."

uphold_catholic_prelates_and_archbishop_desc:0 "The Eastern Orthodox clergy are not completely broken, but they are also not on the same level of power that they used to be what with our empire being as resurgent as it is. The Papacy is greatly pleased with how Catholicism is making its way toward eastern lands and we are working to ensure that the true and proper word of God is spread to the lands we've conquered in earnest. These lands will be organized according to Catholic-oriented doctrine and traditions, for the old Eastern Orthodox ones may now be relegated to the annals of history."

out_of_greek_bureaucracy_and_to_a_new_form_desc:0 "The old systems are slowly being chipped away at and reworked to having a Catholic and Latin feel to them. Whether it is in collecting taxes or trading in various resources, the Latin Empire is transforming how the communities of Greeks served the administration so that they are more in line with Latin prospects. All of this, of course, is being aided by faithful Catholic allies in the west and Papal emissaries who wish to bolster our progress as a whole."

legacy_of_the_crusaders_founding_desc:0 "The mess that was the Fourth Crusade in 1202-1204 rocked the entirety of Christendom since it involved so many influential people and states. In the ashes that fell down from the burning Byzantine cities and fortifications, the Latin Empire rose up and established itself alongside other crusader states, and of course the bastard state of Nicaea. This crusading foundation of our past is something that is not always shrouded in the best light, but it gives our leaders and soldiers a courageous and militant legacy to live up to. We certainly will strive to do as they did, only, next time serving for a clear purpose and without international politics getting in the way."
bedrock_legacy_in_maharashtra:0 "Legacies in Maharashtra"
bedrock_legacy_in_maharashtra_desc:0 "Our legacy dates back to some of the earliest days of written records in the subcontinent. Our region, Maharashtra, was ruled by several dynasties in the past such as the Satavahana, Rashtrakuta, and the Seuna Yadava; most of them had a bedrock foundation of Marathi people ready to do whatever tasks that were needed. Now that we Marathi people are independent and thriving, we will retake our homeland and revitalize the ambitions of previous rulers of Maharashtra."

sheer_quantity_of_maratha_ranks_desc:0 "Marathi people are the most numerous people in all of the Deccan, according to some estimates, and it is this quantity of people that we draw from for the majority of our military affairs. Not only this though, our commanders lead from the front and are willing to put everything on the line in battle to claim victory no matter the cost. Such is the undying will of the Marathas that is shown in the heat of battle."

capable_reformation_of_maratha_governance_desc:0 "Despite what outsiders may think of us, we are not some workers caste that can work merely with tools and weapons and nothing more. Politics in the lands of the Marathas shifts regularly yes, but politics can be centralized over time if our leaders are strong enough both in character and in physique. Multi-lingual will our courts be, weaving the thoughts and sounds of Marathi and non-Marathi people together."
coastal_and_inland_defensive_works:0 "Maratha Defensive Positioning"
coastal_and_inland_defensive_works_desc:0 "It is not enough for the Marathi people to control Maharashtra and nearby regions through justified authority; should any invader break through our perimeter, we will need fortifications to deny them access to our interior. Thus, let us take up the mantle of our ancestors and build up strong domains of stone and metal that can withstand those who would see our great people subjugated and exploited."
light_cavalry_of_maharashtra:0 "Advantages of Light Cavalry"
light_cavalry_of_maharashtra_desc:0 "We have seen the usage of heavy cavalry and elephant cavalry be pivotal to deciding previous conflicts, but muskets and cannons are dominating the field of battle more and more, are they not? We need not waste our time with burdensome heavy metal coats on our horsemen when they should be relying on speed and firepower instead. Light Maratha cavalry striking at enemy supply lines and scouting ahead for moving Maratha armies will be key in aiding our future conquests."
through_coastal_jungle_is_our_navy:0 "Up and Coming Navy"
through_coastal_jungle_is_our_navy_desc:0 "For far too long our ancestors in Maharashtra took very little interest in naval matters; a fleet of ships was of little use to them back then. Today though, the politics of the Marathas dictates that naval matters be made a higher priority for the entire state. Old shipyards and docks on our coast that are traditionally used for trade missions can be fitted to produce great Maratha ships both big and small so that, should any invaders seek a naval landing against us, we can meet them without fear on the water."
ashtapradhan_the_council_of_eight:0 "Establishing the Ashta Pradhan"
ashtapradhan_the_council_of_eight_desc:0 "A dynamic and consistently moving administration is one that can adapt to the various winds of change that the world brings about; stagnation usually means suffering the ravages of corruption and decadence. It is in following in this political philosophy that the Marathi people will be represented more fully through a more dynamic government: the Ashta Pradhan. Utilizing more or less eight ministers (such as a Finance Minister and a Foreign Minister) to help modernize and smooth out the rough edges of our government will undoubtedly prepare us for whatever comes next."

memories_at_chittor_desc:0 "Chittorgarh ('garh' in the name meaning 'fort') has been around since before the 700s and has remained a key location from which rulers exuded power and influence from. From the old Guhila rulers to the siege laid by Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate, Chittogarh remains as a prime facet of Mewar today and should be an example of what can be achieved when Rajputs go on the defensive."
ruthless_muslim_conflicts:0 "Encroaching Muslim Dynasties"
ruthless_muslim_conflicts_desc:0 "From the time of Rana Hammir and his sons, the entirety of Mewar has been threatened by Muslim invaders. 1326 saw Rana Hammir vanquish the Delhi Sultanate from our heartland at the Battle of Singoli and later on, Kshetra Singh defeated Dilawar Khan of Malwa; even the grandson of Kshetra, Lakha Singh, defeated Zafar Khan of Gujarat! Truly it can be said that Mewar as well as other Rajputs have and continue to be in a fight for their religious lives."
settle_the_succession_scores:0 "Settle the Score"
settle_the_succession_scores_desc:0 "Feuding clans across Rajput territory is nothing new, especially in Mewar since holding power amidst the chaotic landscape is a tempting proposition for a variety of people. Our own Mokal Singh who reigned from 1421 to 1433 was assassinated at the age of 24 by his paternal uncles, leading to Mokal's son, Rana Kumbha, coming to power. If we are to stop future succession crises like the one that happened with Mokal Singh, we must learn to deal with the various Rajput clans in our domain."

gunpowder_integration_into_mewar_desc:0 "If there is one thing Muslim invaders have paved the way for that we of Mewar should be eager to take up, it is gunpowder weapons. Their ease of use and just how quickly they can kill in the heat of battle means that we of Mewar are going to be suffering greatly if we cannot start our own production of gunpowder weapons."
reliance_on_our_own:0 "Self Reliance is Self Righteous"
reliance_on_our_own_desc:0 "To rely on mostly on Rajput people alone is tough for Mewar, but it is not impossible. By making diplomatic compromises and gaining a more unified presence across the Rajput heartland, we can turn away from Gujarati, Punjabi, and Sindhi levies and instead recruit more of our people. We have come this far with a core of Rajput strength in the face of harsh odds, why shouldn't be continue on this path of self-righteousness?"

unified_rajput_military_desc:0 "No longer do we need to worry about various clans like the Sisodia or the Rathore breaking off and forming their own military contingents that are independent of our central authority.

True to their reputation, these mostly Rajput soldiers of the Ujjainiya Parmar clan are fearsome experts in terms of using gunpowder weapons and we have the opportunity to levy our cultural ties to them. The more we integrate these strong soldiers into our ranks, the more effective our military as a whole will be thanks to the normalization of gunpowder weaponry."
clan_loyalties_resolved:0 "Resolving Clan Disputes"
clan_loyalties_resolved_desc:0 "If we cannot overcome the disputes between various clans, how will Rajputana ever survive when it needs to consolidate its internal holdings? By taking a closer look at our legal structure and sorting through the various clans in an official sense (perhaps with an official registry of sorts), we can more effectively see to it that clan feuds are ended in bloodless rulings, thus garnering us more talented people for all of Rajputana to benefit from."

traversing_the_thar_regularly_desc:0 "The heartland of Rajputana is marked by the Thar Desert. It is by no means as brutal as the Sahara or the middle of the Arabian Peninsula, but it still is home to a variety of Rajput clans that contribute to Rajputana's strength. Traversing the Thar Desert regularly will undoubtedly teach our soldiers benefit of being mobile and being able to ration supplies when they need to."
discipline_to_defend_the_subcontinent:0 "Generational Discipline"
discipline_to_defend_the_subcontinent_desc:0 "The martial heritage that Rajput people are known for is not just mythical or a fanciful tale. For generations upon generations, Rajputs not only defended their own heartland from Muslim incursions but they also reached out and established dynasties of their own all across the subcontinent. For centuries they showed discipline both on the field of battle and in ceremonial courts, all of which Rajputana emulates in a form that is above all others from the past."
muslim_and_persian_statecraft:0 "The Delhi State Project"
muslim_and_persian_statecraft_desc:0 "Unlike the Ghaznavids under Mahmud and the Ghurids under Muhammad of Ghor, we of Delhi are centered firmly in the Indian Subcontinent; our ties beyond the Khyber Pass are few and far between. With this in mind, traditions from beyond the Khyber Pass still trickle through and the people that stuck around after the fall of the Ghaznavids and Ghurids still form an integral part of Delhi's upper class. Thus, the project of reforming Delhi's politics in the midst of a population mostly of nonbelievers is something to be studied throughout time."

examine_econmics_once_more_desc:0 "Our economy is nothing like what it once was, though the policies of heavy government involvements left behind by Alauddin Khalji are still felt to this very day. He enstated rigid price controls, instituted harsh penalties on breaking regulations he set out, banned investors of capital in several commodity markets, and tried to ensure that the government itself had a firm grip over every facet of mercantile matters led to mixed results. Should we enstate such strict economic measures again? Can we reform them into something more moderate? Perhaps we can find a third or fourth alternative as we examine our economic policies and laws over time."

justified_in_authority_through_islam_desc:0 "Though we find ourselves in an ocean of Hindu and Jain traditions across the subcontinent, past sultans of Delhi have usually been more keen on converting people to Islam whenever possible. Sometimes there were positive incentives (like gifts or positions of influence) or sometimes they were prisoners of war who were set free upon conversion to Islam, but whatever the case was, justification to rule Delhi was and often still is seen through and Islamic lens. Soon enough, the likes of this subcontinent can be brought into the good graces of Allah."

All of these rebellions and more tore pieces of the Delhi Sultanate off after the its peak under the Khalji Dynasty, yet all of these regional rebellions still carry with them memories of our conquests.

Whilst it is true that some places eluded our grasp in the past, Delhi is by no means out of options when it comes to rebuilding itself from the ground up.

Forestd areas alongside scattered villages provide the perfect cover for these rebels to take refuge in as we struggle to root them out, yet this process of cutting down rebel forces is giving our military plenty of experience in the matter.

Infighting within the Rasulid Dynasty led to a fracturing of centralized authority altogether, yet all is not lost. Which dynasty or individual will unify Yemen once more? Only time will tell, and whenever Yemen is unified once more, the price for disobedience will be much more heavy than before."

zaidi_or_sunni_in_the_end_desc:0 "The Zaydi imams of the highlands and the Sunni tribes of the lowlands have been in conflict for generations upon generations which has led to a progressive decentralization of authority in Yemen. Once firm central authority is established again, the state religion must be codified in full no matter what it is and the decrees must be spread throughout every single town and city. Once we have done as such, the pious and zealous folks of Yemen will rally to our banners in times of peace and war."
rebuilding_yemeni_trade_ports:0 "We Must Rebuild"
rebuilding_yemeni_trade_ports_desc:0 "Old trade ports like Aden once flourished during the height of the Rasulid Dynasty in the 1300s, but as politics fractured in the 1400s, Yemeni trading ports were not safe for traders and civilians alike which led to a decline in profits. In time, however, we can and will rebuild these important ports with fresh docks, new markets, and functional workshops that people will once again want to visit."

starting_the_mints_of_yemen_again_desc:0 "Minting coins is a true sign of authority and centralization, which is why the mints within Aden, Ta'izz, and Zabid were part of the building blocks of power for the Rasulid Dynasty. If we can start these mints up again and perhaps increase the number of mints in Yemeni lands so that we can exercise more effective control, Yemen's economic growth as a whole will be without question."

learn_through_mosques_and_madrasas_desc:0 "When politics are stable and the economy is cruising, mosques, monuments, and madrasas were built by Yemeni rulers to cement their power and signify just how good things were. Though some have fallen into ruin over the decades, we can and should resurrect the ruined ones and also build structures that demonstrate not only our authority, but also our own architectural style."
revamping_yemeni_production_methods:0 "Revising Old Methods"
revamping_yemeni_production_methods_desc:0 "We have relied on age-old methods of producing various crops for trade and consumption, yet we are constantly getting word of new methods of production as well as new technologies that can be used to aid the cultivation process. Yemeni folks are nothing if not willing to investigate these matters since new methods of production can easily lead to increased profits... If the methods actually work, that is."

Yemen is the heart of where coffee is grown and exported as it is meaning that we have a strong grip on the global market for the intriguing beverage, but more and more we are seeing merchants and envoys seeking to smuggle the plants out of our land to be grown elsewhere. Perhaps we can dissuade these smuggling efforts through more tight trade regulations as well as hiring more merchants to make deals in other foreign markets with regards to coffe in particular."

It is because of this wide range of talent that those of Aden have that others across have sought out our assistance in several matters. From town security to religious scholars, it is undoubtedly true that we of Aden are integral to the very survival of Yemen as a whole."
internal_expansion_is_needed:0 "Resolving the Internal Struggles"
internal_expansion_is_needed_desc:0 "Several generations have gone by with periods of peace and prosperity, yet rebellions do rise up when corruption or controversy spread from place to place in Yemen. We of Aden are no stranger to these rebellions either as various parts of our own area rebel when scandals break out amongst our highest officials. Thus it is our duty to ensure the safety of not only other Yemeni towns far away from Aden, but also Yemeni towns that are under our direct authority."

religious_dissent_in_yemen_desc:0 "Aden has been a prosperous city in previous years, but others parts of Yemen struggle due to the lack of resources and wealth they get. Tribal ties are much stronger in these scattered areas and it is also in these tribal areas that we find those that disagree with us on the matter of Islam itself, causing controversy after controversy since they are still very much Yemeni in culture. Sooner or later, we must root out these religious agitators and ensure Yemen's stability."

crisis_in_legitimacy_throughout_yemen_desc:0 "Yemen's internal struggles are not limited to how various tribes and clans interpret Islam or how outsiders view Yemen as a whole, the internal struggles extend to how the very Yemeni people that give us taxes and contribute arms to our military view the administration as a whole! If we of Aden want to ensure that Yemen as a whole can stay stable and prosperous, then we will need to cultivate trust with the people of the land over time."

sealing_yemen_from_outsiders_desc:0 "Though we have a commanding influence across various parts of Yemen, we are very much still trying to remedy relations domestically and internationally. As we assure that Aden as well as Yemen as a whole is safe from internal strife, we must also be sure that our defensive measures are capable of withstanding foreign invasion or influence. Robust economics as well as robust walls, those are the keys to our future defensive success."

renewed_trade_efforts_desc:0 "Mercantile matters are what keep Yemeni people afloat in this ever changing world, mostly. Internal taxation has its place, but performing trade with incoming traders from places like al-Qahirah, Muqdisho, and Goa is what really brings in profits for most Yemeni towns. Through Aden's helpful guidance, we can and will restructure the trade practices and markets of Yemen as a whole so that trade can flow like it did in the past."

compounding_upon_centralization_efforts_desc:0 "Prosperity through Aden's hard work is easy to enjoy, yet the labor we put into all of our buildings, ships, weapons, and defensive walls was not cheap. We must never forget the successes and failures that were made along the way to get where we are. Future generations can and will learn from the documents written here and now about how we have helped guide Yemen toward a path of greatness."
recognize_and_keep_matrilineal_succession:0 "By the Women of Kongo"
recognize_and_keep_matrilineal_succession_desc:0 "For generations upon generations we have had a system of succession based primarily on women as opposed to men. Some may find it odd, but we of Kongo find it to be a stabilizing force throughout our villages and towns since it keeps both men and women involved in important matters. From politics to inheritance, almost no space in Kongo is beyond the reach of a powerful woman's influence."

the_royal_monopoly_on_nzimbu_desc:0 "It has been used for as long as we can remember and to this day, it is still useful! The shells of sea snails that are harvested and curated by those specifically loyal to our royal family must be circulated around to keep commerce flowing since most people in our land use it as currency (called 'nzimbu'), but we must also be sure to not let others intrude on the harvesting and refining process. Keeping the monopoly on nzimbu is perhaps one of the most underrated yet most crucial parts to our grip on authority."

traps_throughout_kongolese_defenses_desc:0 "Should we simply let nature try to sweep away the enemies that besiege our walls and towns?The foolish would say yes whilst the wary would say no, and it is the latter by which we are falling in line with more and more. The defenses we build up are good enough for small raids, but if an enemy state nearby launches a full-scale invasion into our land, what are we of Kongo to do? Build more defensive works, that is what! External traps as well as internal ambush points can be the difference between gaining a crucial edge on our enemy or falling to their terrible might."

how_to_handle_the_ne_mbanda_mbanda_desc:0 "When it comes to legitimzing our royal authority, it is the Ne Mbanda-Mbanda that do exactly this. The leader of Kongo cannot do much without the official consent of this governing body; the leader cannot declare war, make or take appointments, or even open or close roads without the proper consent. Being composed of 12 members and divided into 3 groups (4 non-elected bureacrats, 4 councilor-electors, and 4 great women led by the queen-mother), there is an abundance of advice available for our leader, but there is a distinct lack of absolute authority."

the_nzandu_are_neutral_grounds_for_all_desc:0 "A hub of social life and economic activity, the markets of Kongo are perhaps some of the most prolific and prosperous in the entire region. Over time, these markets, or 'nzandu', of ours have become a place where peace is guaranteed by the Kongolese leader and defended from attack at all times. Religious rituals take place here as well as the selling of priceless goods like ivory, weapons, and slaves, meaning that each nzandu is a valuable asset toward diplomatic and mercantile efforts."
the_slave_market_grows_as_we_do:0 "The Growth of Slavery"
the_slave_market_grows_as_we_do_desc:0 "Long has the capture and sale of slaves been around in our land and in the lands of our neighbors. Whilst we do have some standardized rules on slavery such as war captives being the majority of slaves and disallowing female slaves from being exported, we cannot deny that the market for slaves is increasing steadily with time. Our contact with foreigners from beyond our local region has meant that we can sell to buyers from much further away, and being that we are one of the largest slave exporters around, we should be taking advantage of this monetary opportunity."
testing_our_weapons_on_ourselves:0 "When is the Succession Safe?"
testing_our_weapons_on_ourselves_desc:0 "Royal authority in Kongo is rarely ever secured from one generation to another; a ruler may want to choose their heir, but factors beyond the ruler are often ready to pull deadly strings. From people in the Ne Mbanda-Mbanda supporting someone else for the throne to a relative of the newly crowned ruler claiming they should be on the throne instead, we have had and will continue to fight civil strife whenever it arises. It is not ideal for Kongolese people to fight like this, but it keeps us as a state from becoming too complacent or decadent."

sobas_ruling_over_murindas_desc:0 "Long have we had an ngola (king), and long have we had sobas (nobles) governing the various murindas (territories) that Ndongo covers. There are plenty of changes that happen between the sobas, however, and not every territory remains static throughout the years. Some murindas break apart or come together through a variety of means; the end result are various chains of territories coming together to become kandas (provinces). We must admit though that kandas mostly come about through sobas fighting each other, something they seem to take pride in."

trust_in_the_tendala_desc:0 "The work of the ngola is night and day! There is no end to the responsibilities of the leader of Ndongo and it is because of this endless list of things to do that various government positions have been created throughout the generations. One of the most important government positions is that of the tendala, the chief advisor to the ngola, who manages a great deal of day-to-day duties which helps alleviate some of the pressure."

mbundu_unity_from_the_very_start_desc:0 "From the very inception of Ndongo there has been a sense of shared unity amongst our people. We Mbundu people are not exactly like our neighbors and this has been known for several generations, yet we do share some similar traits like having a matrilineal inheritance and succession traditions. As such, we are able to get along with our neighbors whilst also distinguishing ourselves in a variety of ways; it is this shared distinction amongst the Mbundu people as a whole that will never be broken."
rely_on_agility_in_combat:0 "Agility is Strength"
rely_on_agility_in_combat_desc:0 "Unlike our neighbors who prefer shields for combat, the fine soldiers of Ndongo seek agility instead of raw strength and defense alone. We train the fighters of Ndongo in agile combat practices that involve dodging spear thrusts, sword swings, and even thrown javelins; such swift control over bodily movements is needed when in the heat of combat. Even with the advent of gunpowder weapons, moving quick and moving with purpose is key to ensuring success since it can allow a fighter to get into cover safely or get a crucial shot off first."
commanding_the_local_rivers:0 "Affirm River Control"
commanding_the_local_rivers_desc:0 "The rivers of Ndongo are key to accessing the various trade opportunities throughout our land, yet raiders and brigands are always keen on chipping away at our authority on the water. By establishing a stronger presence in all rivers we control through robust military canoes with trained crews, we will be able to stave off more raids on our trade routes and thus secure more financial stability for all of Ndongo."
field_fortifications_ready_to_build:0 "Fortifications by Ndongo Troops"
field_fortifications_ready_to_build_desc:0 "The fighting forces of Ndongo are powerful as it is, though prolonged wars continue to test the strength of every soldier we rely on. As the endurance of our military increases, so to do the tactics employed by them since they may have to venture off to far off lands that have few if any places of respite. That is why drilling our soldiers in how to build field fortifications when campaigning will not only bolster their defensive ability, it will help keep them together as disciplined units under our command."
strict_slavery_practices:0 "Strict Slavery Practices"
strict_slavery_practices_desc:0 "There is a strict social structure within Ndongo that we have had for as long as we can remember. There are the ana murinda (free commoners), then there are the ijiko (enslaved commoners captured via war) and the abika (judicially enslaved people). For the two latter classes of people in Ndongo, the ijiko may not be sold off and are instead attached to pieces of land; the abika may be sold off in the slave market. The sale of a slave is something to be taken seriously, however, and it is our duty to interview every slave marked to be sold off so that their slavery is legitimate."

A new ruler of Loango will come from one province after another in succession so that, ideally, our royal family can share power with various members over time and thus secure a sense of legitimacy amongst the people they rule over."

the_affairs_of_women_in_loango_desc:0 "In Loango politics, the issues and concerns of various high-status women are brought forth due to the fact that we follow a system of matrilineal succession. Foreigners may find it odd that women are able to have such an influential role in politics for us, but this has been a tradition for generations in Loango! The issues brought forth as well as the advice women bring to our royal court help balance out the various men bring so that even debates can be had."

Whilst this is nice for our monetary situation, we must be wary of how exactly these members of our family use this new wealth they are gathering... Not every member of the royal family can be trusted, as it turns out."
attention_to_dispensing_justice:0 "Justice in Loango"
attention_to_dispensing_justice_desc:0 "There must be a balance between the will of the people and the will of the leader in these lands of ours; Loango will not fall prey to peasants taking justice into their own hands. In order to help this stance of ours, our leader is having an increasing level of oversight with regards to hearing cases from people and also resolving these cases as fairly as possible. Our leader is never truly impartial, unfortunately, but they should certainly strive to be when it comes to judging the people of the land."
no_central_religious_authority:0 "Individual Village Religious Matters"
no_central_religious_authority_desc:0 "The beliefs of the farmers, miners, weavers, and miners of our land are of little importance to us compared to the actual tribute they send us. If they wish to erect a shrine to a local nkisi (spirit) or contact the divinity through elaborate ceremonies, they may do as such under our watch up until it gets in the way of tribute being sent or provincial governance being disrupted. This hands-off approach cosmology and theology usually lets our villages thrive whilst also letting them express themselves how they always have."

working_to_refuse_interregnums_desc:0 "There are good, honest people that work for the leader of Loango, and there are also devious, corrupt people that work for them as well. The latter would see the succession of leaders be halted so that the advisors and courtiers (who are usually from the royal family) take control of politics and run the entire realm into a decentralized mess, something we must work against at all costs. In this sense, we should cultivate a stronger base of royal power through advisors that are purely loyal to the leader instead of the royal family as a whole."
proper_tribute_from_inner_villages:0 "Regular Tribute, Regular Peace"
proper_tribute_from_inner_villages_desc:0 "Inner peace in Loango is the result of careful management of internal affairs mostly. From ensuring the royal family is influential, competent, and not a threat to succesion, to ensuring that the military is in order and ready to defend Loango at all times, few if any of us pay attention to what helps keep peace on the level of villages: tribute! Encouraging a standardized system of tribute in the form of currency, soldiers, raw materials, or other resources that we need is exactly what will help keep our people at peace since they know exactly what to expect; nothing more, nothing less."

Copper, a highly prized metal that is useful several ways ranging from helping make tools and weapons to helping facilitate trade deals. Others envy our copper mines to the point that they would attempt to take them away from us, but we will defend them will our might since the copper trade is a large part of what lines our pockets."

No invader ever leaves the lands of the Tyo without bleeding just like we do, but our fighters routinely show the courage to keep fighting no matter the odds.

poison_arrows_of_the_anziku_desc:0 "Others might fight with regular throwing spears or arrows that can do reasonable amounts of damage, but isolation has led us to discover more effective ways of inflicting harm on our foes. Arrowheads coated in poison taken from wild animals in our land will help ensure that whoever is pierced by Tyo projectiles will be marked forever by us; very few have ever survived such a mark."

struggles_for_kongo_trade_routes_desc:0 "The main trade routes across the region go alongside or through the rivers, but the waters are never as calm as they may seem. Routinely there are skirmishes and pitched battles fought over who controls what part of the rivers in the region so that trade routes may be monopolized by one family, tribe, or state, but rarely do they hold the lucrative routes for long. We are no different in this sense; we must fight as hard as we can for the river trade routes and settle matters on the field of battle."

scars_and_hairstyles_and_braids_desc:0 "What makes us, the Tyo people, different from others around us? The scars we inflict on ourselves; the hairstyles we cultivate; the braids by which we decorate ourselves with.

When these invaders show their blades and teeth to us as intimidation; when they strike at us with fire and metal alike, do we submit after one or two strikes? No we do not!

If you are not victorious in battle, you will likely end up being a slave or suffering from subjugation in one form or another.

It is not uncommon for our fighters to also be competent engineers to some degree since they have to put together temporary shelters that can withstand the wind, rain, and heat. In times of ambushes or prolonged battles that stretch across large distances, these temporary shelters can become great places for our warriors to break the advance of the enemy."

to_hunt_is_to_be_a_man_desc:0 "To be a man in our culture means one must be a hunter, there is no getting around this fact. Hunting means more than just obtaining food for a family or tribe; it symbolizes prosperity and the capability a person truly has. Of course, people rarely ever hunt alone; Yaka hunting parties are almost sacred affairs due to various practices done before the actual hunt begins, like practicing sexual abstinence, playing the kasengo-sengo (a flute of sorts), and giving gifts of palm wine and kola nuts in the hopes of a good hunt."

There will be no far off overlord that tells how to divide our profits nor what we should focus on producing; if we seek to indulge in coffee, sugar, grain, tobacco, or whatever else, it will be because of our honest efforts."

dangers_from_the_coast_desc:0 "The wealth that we grow along the coast is bringing us more and more wealth as time goes on, but we are not the only ones that seek this kind of wealth. Anyone ranging from privateers to foreigners from far off coasts might seek to land on our shores and seize pieces of our land so that they too can cash in on the growing global market, yet it is exactly these scenarios in which we have been planning for. Strategic coastal defenses that can assist our navy in deterring hostile fleets will help defend Brazil as a whole."

fending_for_our_own_people_desc:0 "It is through our experiences defending our land from internal issues and external invaders that we are becoming a true state. Despite the pretenses of our old overlords or other foreign states that shrug us off as some revolting colony, we have come a long way from arming mere farmers and miners with muskets and spears. We have taken lessons from our former masters; we are still learning how to organize our military measures; and going forward, we will look toward self defense through population that fights with absolute conviction."

rebellious_flames_across_brazil_desc:0 "Prosperity is what we all strive for, is it not? Yet such a noble goal has its journey filled with terrors and hardships that we of Brazil know all too well. Rebellious groups that seek to pry away valuable pieces of land; foreigners that seek to stoke the flames of rebellion; all of them are seeking to pull us away from prosperity. It is through these numerous hardships, however, that our military becomes hardened over time; their experience fighting peasants and foreigners alike in our own land is bloody but necessary work."

Though much progress has been made, we cannot deny that there are still several looming questions that will need to be addressed not just once or twice, but several times over in the generations to come. Who can sign up for the military or navy? How are laws passed and enforced? What professions and trades are regulated? All of these and more can and will be answered, we just need enough time..."

guj_garba_desc:0 "Originating out of the worship of the Hindu Goddess Ambaji by women through dance, our people have refined a new and very graceful form of dance called the Garba. The basics of the dance are singing and clapping rhythmically in a circular formation. Today, our men and women gather together to use this dance to celebrate any occasion with great fervor, coming together as a community and wearing exquisitely embroidered outfits. All of us together, young and old, peasant and prince, Muslim and Hindu, dancing in an ever growing circle."
born_into_regional_conflict:0 "Raised amidst Conflict"
born_into_regional_conflict_desc:0 "The inception of our state was not through a peaceful transition of power in the slightest, no, it was done through usurpations of power and active rebellion against the Delhi Sultanate of old. From the times of Sikander Khan replacing the other governors in Gujarat in the late 1300s but being being defeated and killed in action, to the times of Muzaffar Shah I being usurped by his son only for said son to die shortly after on a campaign toward Delhi, there have been very few times where we have known periods of prolonged peace."

old_chaulukya_ways_of_governance_desc:0 "To many ignorant courtiers of ours, the times of the old Chaulukya and Vaghela dynasties are but myths told by locals over and over again, but the reality of things are much different. The way those old dynasties governed is very much how we still extract taxes across our state as a whole. Whilst we have tweaked certain aspects like how many sarkars (administrative units) there really are, it is thanks to the old governing system we inherited that we are able to keep the majority of people satiated."

rein_in_the_rajput_polities_desc:0 "Despite our prosperous coastal towns and cities, there are plenty of issues that cannot be resolved through the gathering of wealth alone. One serious issue we must address is the notion of rajput clans on our northern and eastern border since they are more than capable of levying armies that, when combined together, can overwhelm armies like our own. We must be strategic and decisive with our conquests if we plan on curtailing rajput ambitions against us."

the_merchants_script_desc:0 "Whilst the influence of other regal languages flows through the halls of neighboring states, we of Gujarat are seeing the cultivation of something different. In past centuries it was a mere local script and languages, but more and more we are seeing Gujarati Lipi (Gujarati Script) become used by more people throughout our land for documents ranging from laws to trade deals. Perhaps there is merit to helping spread the usage of this 'merchant's script' since it seems to be used mostly to facilitate trade deals across each and every trade hub we control."
blended_architecture_of_gujarat:0 "New Style, Same Cost"
blended_architecture_of_gujarat_desc:0 "The cultivation of our state is partly based on the royal family and how they conduct themselves, but another way to cultivate our state that can be seen by locals every single day is through building monuments! They don't have to just be statues since we are actively seeing our engineers and nobility strive for new styles when they erect new mosques and new fortifications. Despite the building costs never going down, these new details and features in each of our largest structures is something that we are eager to encourage."

Wealth flows in from our trade routes at rates that can't be matched elsewhere, yet it is not just luxury goods that we trade in. The shipping of gunpowder weapons both old and new is certainly becoming a factor we are paying attention to since we can furnish our military with said weaponry or perhaps even experiment with new designs that come to us through mercantile deals."

The great armies wielded by the Ganga Dynasty are now ours and, for the most part, we have not changed their structure. Slowly building up and refining what is already in place for the various armies we field means we do not need to work nearly as hard to keep our military presence throughout the entire region."

With the trio of deities (Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra) inside being worshipped regularly by both royals and commoners alike, it is up to our ruler to patronize the expansion of the temple itself as well as the services it seeks to provide for the faithful adherents that come by. Whether it is showing off the wondrous dances involved Odissi or putting forth glorious sanskrit plays for all to see, Jagannath Temple will continue to serve as the religious heart of our empire."

Whether said foes come from Muslim states in the north or south, from the rising power of Vijayanagara in the south, or even from our own internal subjects that might seek independence, our empire must brace itself with military might to hold what land we have conquered so far."

music_flows_toward_the_army_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the more outstanding features of our military is our usage of instruments in our ranks. Not limiting our soldiers to just marching to the sound of feet on the ground or the sounds of nature, we actually have several small contingents of soldiers that are dedicated solely to playing wonderful tunes and melodies so that our soldiers can go into battle with a slightly better attitude and mindset."
engineering_success_for_the_military:0 "Clearing Every Path"
engineering_success_for_the_military_desc:0 "Another facet of our military is of course the growing sector of engineers that are trained specifically to clear natural foliage out of the way and mark which paths or roads are viable for travel. Not having our dedicated soldiers do this work means that we will have more capable fighters at the front, both in terms of making the journey on time and not dying from felling trees in order to clear a path."

rise_of_the_bhakti_movement_desc:0 "Though militancy has been a key feature of our empire for generations upon generations, the religious movements that flow through Odisha are always changing. The Bhakti religious movement has been gaining ground in our realm as of late and it threatens to undermine certain parts of our military-oriented government, but not everyone is a dedicated follower of this movement. Whilst we take time to deliberate on how we should treat this up-and-coming religious shift, we can at least open ourselves up to debates and dialogues with serious Bhakti adherents."

The failures from Delhi afterwards meant that, in the mid to late 1300s, we have been able to assert Telugu authority once more with the assistance of the brahmins.

This process of slowly refining our state with the aid of the brahmins has also meant that a great deal of warriors loyal to our traditions are flocking to our banners, seeking to fight against the remnants of the Delhi Sultanate that are scattered around us.

It is true that both sides wish to subjugate the Telugu communities and our constant defection and side-switching has yielded worse and worse results, but we still hold some degree of power!

During that period of time, he is said to have obtained a title specific to defeating five Pandya royals in the battle of Kanchipuram. To this day we still use this title of 'Pandya-raja-gaja-kesari' (a lion against the Pandya elephants) and we are always striving to live up to that pivotal moment of success, wherein against the odds we turn the tide of battle and succeed when all others think we will fail."

The failures of our diplomacy and military in the past led to the nobility and royalty of the land being scattered with very little power outside their own small domains.

These courtiers of ours are blind to the reality of our situation! We cannot afford to protect other states around us when we are struggling to maintain our own politics and diplomacy!

Though we are much stronger than both the previous states of Sagaing and Pinya, we still face the threat of Shan raids to this very day, and possibly even an invasion by the Shan people if they somehow unify into a single state.

The growth our state experiences can be felt in every walk of life, but especially so within the regiments of our military. New communities that speak a variety of languages (some of which are familiar with) are becoming accepted in Baroda as a whole, and this is reflected in the way we respect and account for the varied cultural backgrounds of our own soldiers and officers."

Our origins lie in the death of the Hoysala Kingdom in the mid-1300s and we are dedicated to succeeding where they left off in the region.

Our most persistent foe, the sultans of Bahmanis, rebelled against their overlords in the mid-1300s, meaning both us and them have had similar amounts of time to build up bases of power and authority.

Dormant trade routes toward the east and west are becoming lively once more; we are seeing goods like copper, cotton, pearls, pepper, and ginger being both exported and imported in large quantities.

And yet, we can see that there are some changes happening across our realm as the years go by. Some castes are becoming more prestigious, others are becoming less desirable, and still others are changing in how they are defined by our people. Whatever changes we may observe, we should attempt to work within the current bounds rather than trying to manually change how certain castes are viewed and treated."

Ever since the days of Samprati( 5th emperor of the Maurya Empire) who ordered this temple to be built with the idol of Sambhavanatha inside, it has remained a holy site for Jains across the land. Later on, it became more closely associated with the Svetambara sect of Jainism, yet that does not exclude the Digambara sect in the slightest; all Jains are welcome in Pavagadh, for it is with their assistance and spirituality that we are made better as state and as a people."

The domination of the Gujarat Sultanate, the influence of the Malwa Sultanate, and the movements of rajput clans back and forth across the two regions means that we of Champaner must always be wary of what political and military shifts go on, and if we can capitalize on a few rogue regiments selling their services to locals, why not take them up on the offer?"

hill_climbs_in_regularity_desc:0 "Despite some of our officals seeming to be indulgent and gluttonous, most if not all of the working and ruling class in Champaner are active in their daily lives. This is due in part to the fact that Champaner and Pavagadh are located in tough, tropical terrain that requires a great deal of effort to work through. It should come as no surprise that our soldiers are some of the most flexible when it comes to moving across rough terrain and staying alive in tropical weather."

It is up to us to prepare for these inevitable future conflicts through adopting more innovative weaponry and putting both muskets and cannons in the hands of our own soldiers. Heavy cavalry and precise archery are not the saving graces that they once were, but being prepared with both as alternatives if our gunpowder weapons fail should always be an option."

We of Mysore need to ensure that when we take our chance to strike at a vulnerable state near us, we take full advantage of their weakness and seize as much territory or resources (or both) as possible. Consolidating said gains will be easier later on, but our focus must be unified when we are gambling our potential independence with these conflicts we participate in."

Whilst we of Mysore appreciate and fund scholarly poets and thinkers still, we are looking toward newer ways of expressing our culture in the form of plays and songs alike. Though both in an early phase as of now, our direct funding toward these up-and-coming singers, song writers, and playwrights will help inspire the hearts and minds of our citizens."

Early testing has refined these fearsome weapons of war toward being valuable ranged weapons that can both frighten and kill multiple enemy soldiers with just a single rocket.

The tropical hills and valleys that we call home are horrific places to invade due to the amount of natural hazards there are, yet we are perfectly at home in this kind of environment.

The business deals that we are able to do are fine, but the introduction of new ideas on a variety of matters is what we are really interested in. We must keep in mind though that these are traders, not philosophers or bureaucrats, so the ideas they espouse that we can pick up on are mostly financial in nature."

cultural_back_and_forths_desc:0 "Just like how traders and friendly militaries move through our land regualrly, regulary people sometimes move through as well. As time goes on, more and more peasants and lesser nobles are crossing through Mong Kawng and sometimes settling down if they really want to, thus bringing their culture with them. Given how trade links are increasing and our communication with other states is also on the rise, if we want to shape the culture of Mong Kawng even more in the future, we can easily do so with settlers from nearby regions."

Despite the smaller nature of these battles, they are etched into the legends and myths of our people and serve to help bring together more Shan communities toward unification. The only question remains then, which polity will ultimately unite the Shan?"

The Burmese have not sought to exterminate the Shan people of Hsipaw, but rather they have helped us in a variety of ways that we can illustrate clearly. It is through Hsipaw that some cultural bridges between the Shan and Burmese people can be built, but it will take years for this to happen."

take_to_the_sword_in_the_south:0 "Sun Swords Aimed South"
take_to_the_sword_in_the_south_desc:0 "For far too long the southern reaches of our domain have been fairly autonomous due to the terrain, weather, and lack of infrastructure in several areas. Such autonomy has meant that rebellions or enemy forces can gain ground in these areas before we even know what is happening! We must not stand for such autonomy anymore if we want to survive as a state. We will cull these independent local polities with spears and swords at the ready so that we can gain a firm grip over internal politics across our land."
individual_military_merit:0 "Prowess of Individuals, Rewarded"
individual_military_merit_desc:0 "Unlike other states around us, the Han Dyansty falling has meant that people of grand military potential can shine forth. Whereas other states may have a few skilled martials shine forth for a brief time, the Sun Clan actively seeks these men of leadership and fortitude. Such skill also easily makes its way toward the heart of our court, meaning that militarily speaking, we are perhaps the most gifted so far."
encouraging_migrants_to_come_to_us:0 "Welcome to the Land of the Sun!"
encouraging_migrants_to_come_to_us_desc:0 "The intense fighting north of the Yangtze River has meant that several families moved away from places like Luoyang, Chang'an, and Xuchang and toward the south. Being that we are not as economically endowed as some other states, we are happy to welcome these new families into our domain so that we can eventually enact proper taxes on them. In time, these migrants can and will become a new source of power and revenue for the entirety of the Sun Clan."
reinforce_every_single_logistical_sector_possible:0 "Setting Sun No More"
reinforce_every_single_logistical_sector_possible_desc:0 "Gifted in military matters; rising with economic gains; displaying our prestige to others. All of the puzzle pieces are moving into place for the Sun Clan, but we are still just one prolonged conflict or war away from suffering a grave invasion that plunges us into civil strife. We can mitigate these chances of disaster though, can we not? Reinforcing supply lines along the Yangtze River and our coastline alongside cultivating internal road networks for efficient supply routes will ensure that the Sun Clan can withstand an extended periods of conflict."

defeat_never_was_the_end_for_us:0 "Defeat is not Death!"
defeat_never_was_the_end_for_us_desc:0 "The Liu Clan is a distant relative of the royal family that saw the gracious rise and tumultuous fall of the Han Dynasty, yet it is not without potential. There have been plenty of strong candidates that could seize power and battle against the other rising warlords, but defeat is always just around the corner for any ambitious member of the Liu Clan if they make the wrong political or military move. Defeat in this chaotic era is not death, however! Whilst we see defeat in one theater, we can rise again in a different theater if we are righteous to the common people and tactical with our planning!"
sworn_oaths_and_competent_court_efforts:0 "Childhood Oaths; Lifelong Promises"
sworn_oaths_and_competent_court_efforts_desc:0 "Liu Bei's life was full of triumphs and hardships, yet he was not alone in seeing how these events played out. His network of loyal and friendly commanders, tacticians, and courtiers dated all the way back to his early adult years when he sowed the seeds of brotherhood with Zhang Fei and Guan Yu. Such early oaths blossomed into a grandiose working relationship between all three and it is something that future heads of the Liu Clan should absolutely strive to emulate. Childhood friends can easily become some of the most valuable and loyal courtiers one could ever have."
righteous_laws_and_precise_punishments:0 "Laws of the Land for Everyone"
righteous_laws_and_precise_punishments_desc:0 "If ever there is to be true law and order within the Middle Kingdom once more, it must be made clear to every single person that no person, regardless of status or position, is immune to prosecution. If the farmers and weavers that pay fealty to us see that officials are held accountable for their transgressions and misdeeds, their loyalty will never be in question and our administration will become much more efficient in future years."
faovring_defense_by_our_nature:0 "Prioritize Defensive Measures"
faovring_defense_by_our_nature_desc:0 "The swift conquests that some other warlords carry out are startling to say the least; once bustling cities like Luoyang and Chang'an can and have been taken in a matter of days instead of weeks or months. In these dangerous times, the Liu Clan must hold itself together alongside the people it governs through sturdy fortifications. Natural defenses like rivers and hills must be utilized alongside crucial chokepoints so that when an invader strikes toward our heart, we do not fall within a matter of days."
the_chancellor_and_the_emperor:0 "The Position of Chancellor"
the_chancellor_and_the_emperor_desc:0 "To some other states, the position of 'king' or 'emperor' is where all the power can and should reside; anything outside of the monarch's central cadre should be minimized and possibly culled. We of the Liu Clan see things differently, however, thanks to Liu Shan and Zhuge Liang's example. Though Liu Shan was the nominal emperor, Zhuge Liang was the Imperial Chancellor, meaning he managed the bureaucracy at almost all levels. This helps free up the position of the emperor (if Liu Shan was capable of doing so) to do more diplomatic matters with foreign envoys and diplomats."
making_sichuan_economically_viable:0 "Rising from Economic Ruins"
making_sichuan_economically_viable_desc:0 "The downfall of the Han Dynasty has meant that the internal economic situation of the entire Middle Kingdom has been greatly disrupted, to say the least. It may hurt us early on, but reducing taxes and military requirements when we are in such a dire economic state can help us gain the loyalty of the common folk, thus allowing us to rebuild internal economic foundations that were left in ruins when the Han Dynasty ripped itself apart. If we cannot develop our own internal infrastructure for the Liu Clan's holdings, what hope is there to ever expand our influence outward?"
shifting_friends_and_foes_on_all_sides:0 "Papers and Ink; Daggers and Deceit"
shifting_friends_and_foes_on_all_sides_desc:0 "The alliances and rivalries that have erupted since the fall of the Han Dynasty has meant that the Liu Clan must be ready for any number of possible diplomatic situations. Trade deals, assassination attempts, joint attacks, royal marriages, and many more possible scenarios come to our attention and require us to make a decision, lest we let a chance at gaining power slip away. Thus, expanding our diplomatic scope through a more foreign focused lens will bolster our capability of discerning friend from foe, opportunitiy from trap, and honest negotiations from backstabbing deals."
