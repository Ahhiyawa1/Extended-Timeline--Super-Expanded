byz_constitutional.1.desc:0 "Once a powerful ruler, the monarch had become incapable of effectively leading the empire. Years of neglect had left the Empire in disarray, with a struggling economy, social unrest, and a military that was ill-prepared for any conflict. Despite the monarch's best efforts, the empire was slipping further into chaos. The people were growing restless, and there was a growing sense that something needed to be done. It was clear that the monarch was no longer capable of ruling the empire. A replacement was needed, someone who could bring order and stability back to the Empire. The search for a suitable replacement began, and now we have three candidates."
