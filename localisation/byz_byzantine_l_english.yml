 return_to_asia_desc:0 "In the wake of the catastrophe of 1204, it was in Asia, at Nicaea, that our Roman forces regrouped and built up their strength once more to allow them to restore Roman rule to Constantinople. However, in the century following this glorious return, mismanagement and civil war allowed the Mahometan Turks to completely overrun our lands in Anatolia. Now that we have restored order in the Balkans and rebuilt our old imperial government, it is time to take back what is rightfully ours. Our government will aim to drive the Turks from Asia and protect the Romans who still live there."

As our Roman Empire stands upon the brink of being overwhelmed by the infidel Turk, the Pope of Rome has finally agreed to the long-standing Orthodox request for a Great Ecumenical Council to address the question of the Schism between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. However, while the pope has finally conceded an open discussion and debate on questions of reunion, it is not clear that the Roman See's terms will have changed substantially since the last attempt at Church Union in 1274. Yet, in practical terms, we would be grateful of western aid against the Mahometans, while the Roman pope would no doubt be pleased to be able to use the 'return' of the Orthodox to the Catholic fold as a way of facing down demands for reform from his own churchmen who oppose his monopoly of power. Shall we agree to attend the council?"

Most of the Orthodox hierarchy will go along with your imperial decision, but some bishops, most notably Metropolitan Mark Eugenikos of Ephesos, have made it clear that they will resist absolutely any compromises in the Orthodox faith, while it remains doubtful as to how happy our people back at home will be..."

Apparently, a Latin priest has been travelling around our realm, and came to a small mountain village where the relics of a much-revered local saint are kept. He was looking around the church and asking a lot of questions about the saint, and had an entourage of other Latins with him. The villagers clearly saw that he planned to steal the saint's relics, just as the Venetians stole the relics of St Nicholas from Myra in Lycia. They banded together just in time and drove the Latins away forcibly. The Latins have protested the priest's treatment, and demand a response from us."

Both sides, moreover, have claimed victory, but now they look to you for the final decision.
