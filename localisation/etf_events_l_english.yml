etf_event_africa.1.t:0 "The Boers of South Africa"
etf_event_africa.1.d:0 "The Cape of South Africa was originally colonized by Dutch settlers, and for long these settlers identified themselves as such; Dutch. But resentment is brewing in the cape. Resentment against authority, against foreign rule, people are rebelling against their very own Dutch identity."
etf_event_africa.1.ra:0 "'We are boer!'"
etf_event_africa.1.rb:0 "Let's embrace this new culture!"
etf_event_africa.2.t:0 "The Great Trek"
etf_event_africa.2.d:0 "The Boer population of South Africa has for long been at odds with the colonial administration ruling over them. Restrictions on their language, bans on slavery, a more hands-on approach to administration, these are but some of the topics that have left the Boers infuriated with our leadership, leading many to seek fortune beyond the cape...\n\nAs we speak, many of these settlers are beginning to migrate north to establish their own 'Boer' republics."
etf_event_africa.2.r:0 "Happy trails."

etf_event_africa.4.d:0 "Gold has been discovered across the Transvaal. Mining operations are being started everywhere, surely guaranteeing great fortune for us."
etf_event_africa.4.r:0 "We'll be rich!"
etf_event_africa.5.t:0 "Reincorporation of the Boers"
etf_event_africa.5.d:0 "The success of the 'Boer' republics in South Africa is no secret. A few mere decades after leaving the Cape Colony, these settlers have struck both gold and diamond granting them immense wealth. The question of annexation has been brought up, as these semi-independent states are debatably still subjects of the [Root.GetAdjective] Empire, and so our claim to their territory may be justified."
etf_event_africa.5.ra:0 "They're [Root.GetAdjective] subjects, all of them!"
etf_event_africa.5.rb:0 "Leave them be."
etf_event_africa.6.t:0 "Battle of Blood River"
etf_event_africa.6.d:0 "The Battle of Blood River was fought on the bank of the Ncome River in 1838 between 464 Afrikaner 'Voortrekkers' and anywhere between 10000 to 15000 Zulu. The battle ended in a resounding Voortrekker victory, and assured the independence of Natal from Zulu rule."
etf_event_africa.6.ra:0 "They'll pay for this!"
etf_event_africa.6.rb:0 "Onward to §YNatal§!!"
etf_event_africa.10.t:0 "The [host_conference_capital.GetCapitalName] Conference"
etf_event_africa.10.d:0 "Representatives of the world's Great Powers have gathered in [host_conference_capital.GetCapitalName] to discuss the future of Africa. The great continent has remained mostly free from colonial rule due to its harsh terrain and diseases, but modern advances have rendered these concerns negligible. Worry has subsequently grown among those who wish to preserve peace amongst the Great Powers, as some believe a chaotic scramble in Africa could upset the peace at home, hence the need for diplomacy.\n\nThe scramble for Africa can now begin."
etf_event_africa.10.r:0 "We hope to earn our fair share."
etf_event_africa.11.t:0 "Threats against our Freedom"
etf_event_africa.11.d:0 "News has now reached us that a number of European Great Powers have gathered in the city of [host_conference_capital.GetCapitalName] to discuss the conquest of our home, the continent of Africa. Our scouts have reported greater European activity near our frontier borders, and the attitudes of foreign diplomats has recently become increasingly hostile and demanding. Our nation may be in great danger if we're unable to fight these incursions!"
etf_event_africa.11.r:0 "We'll never kneel to invaders!"
etf_event_africa.12.t:0 "Protectorate in [african_sphere.GetNameShort]"
etf_event_africa.12.d:0 "Our influence in [african_sphere.GetName] is widespread, so much so that we may be able to 'convince' local rulers to accept the status of protectorate to 'protect' them from other colonial powers."
etf_event_africa.12.ra:0 "Establish a protectorate in [african_sphere.GetNameShort]."
etf_event_africa.12.rb:0 "We're fine with our existing influence."
etf_event_africa.20.t:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Congo"
etf_event_africa.20.d:0 "In the heart of Africa lies the Congo, a vast jungle of untold wealth and resources. Modern advances have made the region claimable by any colonial power that so wishes, but who shall have it?\nThe [host_conference_capital.GetName] Conference was held with the express purpose of avoiding conflict between colonial powers, but with every nation attending the Conference claiming the region, the debate sits in deadlock. Perhaps we, a neutral minor power, could serve as benevolent 'caretakers' of its wea- I mean inhabitants?"
etf_event_africa.20.ra:0 "We'll take good care of the Congo."
etf_event_africa.20.rb:0 "Colonialist greed knows no limit."
etf_event_africa_annex_congo_title:0 "Annex the Congo Free State"
etf_event_africa_annex_congo_desc:0 "It has become clear to us that the [Root.GetAdjective] colonial authorities in the Congo have... perhaps got a bit overambitious in their efforts to make the colony profitable, so much so that other colonial powers seem horrified of their 'zeal'. Perhaps it would be in our nation's best interest to annex the colony, putting it under more direct control and distancing ourselves from the horrors of the Free State."
etf_event_africa.21.t:0 "Rise of the Mahdists"
etf_event_africa.21.d:0 "A religious and political group has emerged in the Sudan in opposition to our rule in the region. These 'Mahdists' have spread their belief like a plague throughout the Sudan, and the locals are growing increasingly unrestful as we speak."
etf_event_africa.21.r:0 "Keep an eye on this."
etf_event_africa.22.t:0 "Mahdists Revolt!"
etf_event_africa.22.d:0 "A Mahdist-led revolt has succeeded in capturing ground in the Sudan, and has subsequently established a provisional capital in the region. There, they've proclaimed the creation of a 'Mahdist State' and declared a jihad against the local government."
etf_event_africa.22.r:0 "This is bad!"
etf_event_africa.23.t:0 "Mahdist Threat Subsides"
etf_event_africa.23.d:0 "Enough time has passed that the Mahdist movement in the Sudan has lost momentum. We can expect this movement to die out in the near future."
etf_event_africa.23.r:0 "Good."

etf_annexation.1.d:0 "[From.GetNameShortCap] has made an international call for unification, with our nation being one of many in their sights for this goal. We could willingly join them peacefully, or face the consequences of denying the legitimacy of their union..."

etf_annexation.2.rb:0 "What insolence! Summon their ambassador, I want to talk with them."
etf_event_chn.100.t:0 "Opium in China"
etf_event_chn.100.d:0 "Beginning in the 19-century China saw a drastic increase in opium imports, particularly from British Indian markets. This increasing dependence on opium amongst the Chinese population proved disastrous for China, as army discipline and production of goods were stifled. As officials scramble to get the situation under control, the nation lays vulnerable..."

etf_event_chn.200.d:0 "A [GBR_target.GetAdjective] shipment of Opium was recently seized and destroyed by [This.GetAdjective] officials in the port of Canton. [GBR_target.GetAdjective] merchants, already upset with our strict restrictions on foreign trade, have begun demanding action from the [GBR_target.GetAdjective] government, which could mean we're headed towards a war."
