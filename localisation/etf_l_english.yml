   CONCERT_OF_EUROPE_NAME: "Concert of Europe"
   CONCERT_OF_EUROPE_DESC: "The continent of Europe has been in a near continuous state of war for almost 20 years, but with Napoleon finally defeated, peace can return. The post-war order has been established at the Congress of Vienna, and 99 years of peace awaits a tired continent."
   CUBAN_MISSILE_CRISIS_NAME: "Cuban Missile Crisis"
   CUBAN_MISSILE_CRISIS_DESC: "The year is 1962, and the Cold War has reached what some believe to be its peak in terms of tension. US missiles stationed in NATO-aligned Turkey triggered a counter-response from the Soviets, who attempted to secretly station missiles of their own in Cuba. Once US Intelligence uncovered this secret, it triggered a diplomatic crisis between the two superpowers. The world is 7 minutes away from midnight."
   END_OF_WWII_NAME: "End of WW2"
   END_OF_WWII_DESC: "As the Second World War draws to a close, the territories once held by the former Axis powers now find themselves under occupation by the triumphant Allied forces. The delicate balance of peace among the Allies remains at risk, as nations handle the immense challenge of demilitarization. Will the world succeed in forging a lasting peace, or is an even worse conflict just around the corner?"
   HOI4_NAME: "Interwar Period"
   HOI4_DESC: "Tension is rising in the world.\nThe Nazi leadership of Germany has begun a process of rearmament and militarization, an effort led by Adolf Hitler who is calling for "liberation" of German people under foreign rule and revenge against the enforcers of the Versaille Peace.\nMeanwhile in eastern Europe, the Soviets are once again setting their sights on Finland, the Baltics, Poland and Romania as potential avenues for Communist expansion.\nWar between Japan and China seems imminent, as clashes along the Chinese-Manchurian border may soon flare up into something more serious. Will the Democracies of the world be able to preserve peace for our time?"
   WAR_ON_TERROR_NAME: "War on Terror"
   WAR_ON_TERROR_DESC: "September 11th 2001 marked a grim day in American history, as the nation was struck by brutal terrorist attacks targeting and killing thousands of innocent civilians. The American public responded to the attacks with both outrage and sorrow, while President George W. Bush proceeded to announce a "Global War on Terrorism". Afghanistan was invaded in 2001 due to the Taliban's refusal to hand over suspected participants in the 9/11 attacks, and now Iraq is in the US's sights over alleged manufacturing of WMD's."
   WWII_DAY_OF_INFAMY_NAME: "Day of Infamy"
   WWII_DAY_OF_INFAMY_DESC: "Yesterday, December 7th, 1941 - a date which will live in infamy - the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. The attack on Pearl Harbor has necessitated a response from the United States, who's now more than likely to get fully involved in the ongoing conflict of WW2."
   WWII_TURNING_TIDE_NAME: "Turning Tide"
   WWII_TURNING_TIDE_DESC: "The tide of war is turning. An allied invasion in southern Italy proved enough to spook the Italian government into surrender, leading to a hasty occupation of northern Italy by the German military and the establishment of the "Italian Social Republic". Military defeats on the Eastern Front likewise suggest that the war is not necessarily turning in Germany's favor."
   XINHAI_REVOLUTION_NAME: "Xinhai Revolution"
   XINHAI_REVOLUTION_DESC: "Imperial rule in China is in decline. The Qing Dynasty has time and time again proved itself incapable of defending China's interests, as foreign powers grow bolder in their demands for concessions in the country.\nThe people of China are not blind to the issues facing the country, and as foreign influence creeps into the country, so do foreign ideas and ideologies that have enticed the more educated of people.\nRevolutionary anti-Qing cliques are everywhere. In the country, in exile abroad and even within parts of the military anti-Qing sentiments are growing.\nIt seems as though a single spark could ignite complete anarchy."

   string_start_gbr_1836: "It is the dawn of the Victorian Era, and the British Empire is the foremost Great Power of the world. Having benefited from industrialization at home and colonial expansion abroad, Britain has the resources to be a fierce competitor on both land and sea, as well as having an economy that towers over those of other European powers. The British tradition of Parliamentarism has also proven quite beneficial, as the nation has mostly been spared from the revolutionary chaos plaguing other monarchies.\n\nPrincess Victoria is 15 years old, and will soon ascend the British throne as her father nears the end of his life. Her ascension will however create a dispute in the Kingdom of Hannover, as the state's succession laws follow male primogeniture. It is likely our union with Hannover will be interrupted upon Victoria's ascension, as a different member of the family assumes the Hannoverian throne.\n\nBritish colonial holdings in Canada and Australia are split between various colonial governments. Though the colonists have relative autonomy from London, unrest is nonetheless beginning to brew in both regions. It is likely that we will eventually have to find ways of calming them, through either concessions of greater autonomy or swift suppression.\n\nBritish rule in India is currently handled by the Honourable East India Company, a loyal subject state under our supervision. Though most of the Indian subcontinent is under Company rule, parts of it remain under native control, most importantly the powerful Sikh Empire of the north. If we are to fully secure the region, the Sikh's would be our immediate obstacle.\n\nThe United Kingdom stands to enter this new era as an undisputed global power with influence over just about every part of the wider world. The only question that should truly concern us is; where do we expand next?"
   # string_start_usa_1836: "The United States of America was but a humble Great Power by the turn of the 19th-century. The Louisiana purchase nearly doubled it in size and democratic reforms brought settlers from Europe to settle its new western frontier, contributing to a rapid rate of growth and modernization. Perhaps this fledgling nation may one day turn into quite the eagle?\nBut all's not well in the land of the free. The contentious issue of slavery is dividing the nation between Free state north and Slave state south, setting the stage for a conflict that may turn more serious than just oral debate. Trouble in neighboring Mexico over Texan independence may also see our nation dragged into a conflict."
   string_start_pru_1836: "The Kingdom of Prussia exited the Napoleonic wars a great victor. Land gains in the vital Ruhr-region gave the growing power an industrial base to challenge its neighboring rival of Austria, and its widespread influence across Germany makes it a valid candidate for unifying the region into a Great Power Europe has never seen the likes of before."
   string_start_hab_1836: "The Austrian Empire served as the kingmaker of the Congress of Vienna. The power to redraw borders to its needs granted the Austrians considerable influence in both Germany and Italy, and powerful enemies elsewhere...\nWith influence in Germany and Italy comes rivalry with nations seeking to unite these regions, will we be able to defend our hegemony?"
   string_start_rus_1836: "The Russian Empire saw a steep decline in power over the course of the 19th century. The nation which in decades past destroyed Napoleon's army, struggles today to keep up with its modernizing neighbors. Humiliating defeats and backwards monarchs brought the empire to its knees, will you be able to lead this struggling empire down a road of glory?"
   string_start_tur_1836: "The Ottoman Empire, once a scourge of all Christendom and feared invader of Europe, has entered a state of decline. The influence of other nations within its territory is ever increasing, and the demands from the oppressed conquered peoples under its banner grow ever louder with the arrival of nationalism. The Sublime Porte faces an array of issues and challenges to overcome, will they be able to keep the empire together?"
   string_start_ned_1836: "The Netherlands, formerly known as the "Dutch Republic", came out of the Napoleonic Wars with both a monarchy and complete control over the southern lowlands. The Dutch were awarded this territory by the Great Powers of Europe due to the belief that a neutral state controlling land between France and Germany would help promote peace and stability in the region.\n\nThis proved to be a miscalculation, as the predominantly Catholic Belgians chafed under Dutch rule, growing resentful to the point of launching a rebellion in 1830, which succeeded in creating the Kingdom of Belgium of the southern lowlands. In doing so, the Belgians also occupied the regions of Limburg and Luxembourg, whose status remains disputed still.\n\nThough the fighting between the Dutch and the Belgians has largely subsided, the Dutch still have yet to accept Belgian independence. A lasting peace would likely have to be brokered by a neutral third party.\n\nDespite this loss of territory, the Netherlands remains a significant economic power in Europe. The small state holds a vast colonial empire under its control, with spices from the East Indies keeping money flowing into Dutch coffers. What the Netherlands lack in men and land, they make up for in spices and islands."
   string_start_bel_1836: "What is today the Kingdom of Belgium was once a domain of the Habsburg monarchy, but was ceded to the neutral Dutch after the Napoleonic Wars in an attempt to promote peace in the region.\n\nThis proved to be a miscalculation, as the predominantly Catholic Belgians chafed under Dutch rule, growing resentful to the point of launching a rebellion in 1830, which succeeded in creating the Kingdom of Belgium of the southern lowlands. In doing so, the Belgians also occupied the regions of Limburg and Luxembourg, whose status remains disputed still.\n\nThough the fighting between the Dutch and the Belgians has largely subsided, the Dutch still have yet to accept Belgian independence. A lasting peace would likely have to be brokered by a neutral third party.\n\nShould Belgium succeed in brokering peace with the neighboring Dutch, the state is bound to become a prosperous nation. With an already industrializing economy, Belgium is developing a close relationship with their British partners, whose protection is of great significance to the country's continued independence."
   string_start_lux_1836: "The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is in a rough position. The small state had emerged from the Napoleonic Wars as the junior partner in a Personal Union with the King of the Netherlands, but this arrangement was suddenly made more complicated by the Belgian Revolution of 1830. The Belgians claimed the Grand Duchy as their own, which angered not only the Dutch but also the Prussians, who viewed the nation's central fortress as being of strategic interest.\n\nUltimately, the fate of this small nation will have to be decided by its larger neighbors, as its future is likely under either Dutch or Belgian dominion."
   # string_start_fra_1836: "France emerged from the Napoleonic Wars surprisingly intact. Despite the havoc caused in the wars' wake, none of the Great Powers of Europe wished to see France overly punished, as the continent's general attitude towards war turned more strongly towards pacifism, and efforts were made at the Congress of Vienna to lay the groundwork for a more stable European system, the 'Concert of Europe'.\n\nFor France, this meant a warm welcome back into the European family as a fellow conservative monarchy. The Bourbons were returned to power, many of the old political and social systems saw their return, and some of the reforms made during the Revolution were kept to appease the masses.\n\nWhile this return to peace was expected by many to last, the people of France had other ideas. 1830 saw a new wave of smaller revolutions sweep across Europe, France being one of the countries affected. This revolution saw the rise of a new royalist dynasty, the House of Orléans, who hold a much more amicable attitude towards modernization and reform than their predecessors. The new regime is overseeing the rise of constitutional monarchy in France, the rise of industry and an industrialist social class, but many of these new ideas and concepts are likewise creating new problems for the country as well.\n\nSuffrage is limited to a very small portion of the population, clashes between old nobility and new industrialist classes are heating up, and the Orléanists are struggling to hold on to power."
   string_start_swi_1836: "The Cantons of the Swiss Confederation have enjoyed great autonomy and predominant peace for as long as anybody can remember, but change is coming to the Alps...\n\nThe Cantons are growing increasingly polarized on a number of different political issues, federalism, liberalism and religion being some of the issues of controversy. It remains to be seen how these new ideas will affect the Confederation's future."
   string_start_spa_1836: "The Kingdom of Spain in 1836 was embroiled in an ongoing civil war, a political crisis caused by the disputed succession of a former King. The former King had wished for his daughter to rise to the throne, an idea that was denied by the conservatives, who instead backed a distant relative's claim to it.\n\nThe Kingdom's future now lies split between either the liberal 'Christinos' or the conservative 'Carlists', who both have radically different views of how the nation should advance."
   string_start_por_1836: "The Kingdom of Portugal, much like the neighboring Kingdom of Spain, is an Empire in decline. There was a time in history where Portugal was a Great Power, but by the dawn of the Victorian Era, those days were very much over. Brazil, the country's wealthiest colony, broke free not too long ago as a member of the Braganca royal family decided to steer half the Empire down his own route, declaring independence and establishing the Empire of Brazil."
   string_start_blp_1836: "Having progressively fallen under Russian dominion over the course of the 18th century, the §YBaltic Governorates§! now remain autonomous states within the Russian Empire under the local leadership of German 'Balten' nobility.\n\nThough local leadership has long been comfortable with this arrangement, things might be moving towards change. Poland was promised autonomy by Russian leadership after having been conquered in 1815, but that autonomy was curbed less than two decades later. This has left our own nobility worried for our future..."
   
   string_start_north_america_2022: "The war between Russia and Ukraine has had far-reaching consequences for the rest of the globe, with economic instability and worsened access to goods being prevalent issues.\n\nMild political turmoil in Canada and the U.S., as well as cartel-related conflict in Mexico could herald a time of greater instability in North America."
   string_start_south_america_2022: "The war between Russia and Ukraine has had far-reaching consequences for the rest of the globe, with economic instability and worsened access to goods being prevalent issues.\n\nSouth America has been politically divided between two international blocs; Mercosur and UNASUR. Will the continent remain peaceful despite this division?"
   string_start_europe_2022: "The war between Russia and Ukraine has had far-reaching consequences for the rest of the globe, with economic instability and worsened access to goods being prevalent issues.\n\nThe war has triggered an energy crisis in Europe, as without Russian gas, countries now scramble to find alternative sources of energy and means of heating. Despite this, the majority of the continent have been fervent in their support for Ukraine's defense."
   string_start_africa_2022: "The war between Russia and Ukraine has had far-reaching consequences for the rest of the globe, with economic instability and worsened access to goods being prevalent issues.\n\nWith access to food already problematic, the war has not helped Africa's situation. A proxy war may also be taking place within France's African sphere of influence, as Russian mercenaries have been more active in the Sahel."
   string_start_asia_2022: "The war between Russia and Ukraine has had far-reaching consequences for the rest of the globe, with economic instability and worsened access to goods being prevalent issues.\n\nTensions between mainland China and Taiwan have seen an increase, as some worry the PRC may follow in Russia's footsteps and resolve international disputes through more violent means."
   string_start_oceania_2022: "The war between Russia and Ukraine has had far-reaching consequences for the rest of the globe, with economic instability and worsened access to goods being prevalent issues.\n\nThe Pacific has become a battleground for Chinese vs. American "soft power", as both Great Powers strive to influence and sway various island nations to their respective side."
