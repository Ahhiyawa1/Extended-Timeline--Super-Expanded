 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME1: "The Traditional Amazigh Religion"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC1: "It is difficult to fully reconstruct the indigenous religious beliefs of the Berber people prior to the spread of Christianity and Islam into North Africa. As an Afro-Asiatic people, mythological and linguistic comparison with the Phoenician and Egyptian cultures is helpful as well as archeological evidence found throughout North Africa. However, the majority of written evidence concerning Berber religion comes from neighboring (particularly Greek and Egyptian) sources. Additionally, some ancient Berber beliefs continue to exist within modern Berber culture, albeit significantly altered."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT1: "Okay"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME2: "Celebrating Yennayer"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC2: "Yennayer is the first day of the agrarian year used since antiquity by Berber people in North Africa. It corresponds to the first day of January of the Julian Calendar. This is a widespread celebration, during which some rituals take place, mostly operations of cleansing and animal sacrifices. For this year, your advisors have suggested you take an active part in preparing the celebrations. Our people would be very grateful."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT2A: "Join in the celebrations"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT2B: "I have more important things to do!"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME3: "The Legacy of Shoshenq I"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC3: "Shoshenq I was a Berber Pharaoh. He is the founder of the XXII dynasty. He is so popular among our people that his coronation has been taken as the beginning of the Amazigh calendar. Since we own Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt, we have a huge amount of prestige. This prestige can help us to improve our reputation abroad... But we could also remind the world that one of the greatest dynasties of pharaohs is of Amazigh origin. This way, we could pretend to rule over all Egyptian lands."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT3A: "We are the legitimate rulers of Egypt!"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT3B: "The whole world must be in awe of your prestige."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME4: "Restoring the Madghacen"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC4: "The Madghacen is a royal mausoleum-temple of the Berber Numidian Kings, dating from the third century BC. It is a gigantic dome ringed with columns, which is the oldest preserved ancient royal mausoleum in North Africa. However, this magnificent monument is in great danger. Damaged by the ravages of time, weather and looters, the building could collapse at any moment. It is your duty to help in the restoration of one of the greatest symbols of the Amazigh religion."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT4A: "We must restore this monument of our history!"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT4B: "Nah... These are just old stones."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME5: "Building a Pyramid"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC5: "The Berbers and their ancestors believe in life after death. At first, they buried the dead in holes on the ground. Later, they burned the bodies in tombs and burial mounds. These tombs evolved into more advanced forms such as pyramidal tombs, in which the most important personalities were buried. The people of one of our provinces would like to build one of these pyramids for you. Your reputation would stand the test of time, even after your death."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT5A: "I am thankful to my beloved people."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT5B: "I do not want to rot inside a pyramid!"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME6: "Tislit n Anzar"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC6: "Anzar is the God of heaven, waters, rivers, seas, streams, springs and rain. He is often called Aglid n Ugfur, which means \"King of the rain\". A rite known as Tislit n Anzar (The Bride of Anzar) is dedicated to him during periods of drought to rain. The province of $PROVINCENAME$ is about to organize one of these ceremonies, and would like you to be there so they will get the favors of Anzar."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT6A: "I want to participate in this ceremony."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT6B: "I wish I could, but I don't want to."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME7: "A Night With the Dead"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC7: "The cult of the dead among the Amazigh people is different from the other ancient peoples. Ancestors are deified and revered. When someone wants to invoke them to ask something, he sleeps in their graves so that their answer will be given. While you go through a bad patch, you think about the idea of spending a night among your ancestors. Do you feel ready to share your doubts with the rulers of distant past?"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT7A: "I am sure my ancestors will answer my call."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT7B: "Uh... This idea sounds a little too creepy."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME8: "A Night With the Dead"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC8: "You went into the tomb of your ancestors. It took you a long time to fall sleep, because the idea of being among deceased people did not really please you. After an endless night, you woke up without answers to your questions. However, you caught a beautiful cold because the place was cold and wet. You will be in bed for several days, but your people are grateful that you have honored their traditions."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT8: "Achoo!"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME9: "A Night With the Dead"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC9: "You went into the tomb of your ancestors. It took you a long time to fall sleep, because the idea of being among deceased people did not really please you. After an endless night, you woke up with the feeling of having acquired the knowledge of your ancestors. You come out of the grave smiling, ready to lead your nation to glory."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT9: "Fantastic!"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME10: "A Night With the Dead"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC10: "Our $MONARCHTITLE$ entered the tomb of his ancestors. However, a guard discovered that the tomb was open and believed that looters came. As a consequence, he immediately resealed the tomb, locking up our beloved leader. We realized the situation a few days later, but it was too late. Our leader is dead... But let us look on the bright side of things: we will not have to hold expensive funerals, since our leader is already resting in peace among his ancestors."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT10: "Fant... Wait, what do you mean by 'Our leader is dead'?"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME11: "Affinities With Hellenism"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC11: "You have decided to worship a god of Hellenist origin. The good thing is that one of our neighboring nations practice Hellenism. When one of their representatives realized that we worship a god they know, the news spreaded to their capital. Now we have better diplomatic relations with that nation."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT11: "Great"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME12: "Affinities With Canaanism"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC12: "You have decided to worship a god of Phoenician origin. The good thing is that one of our neighboring nations practice Canaanism. When one of their representatives realized that we worship a god they know, the news spreaded to their capital. Now we have better diplomatic relations with that nation."
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT12: "Great"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME13: "Affinities With Pesedjet"
 cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC13: "You have decided to worship a god of Egyptian origin. The good thing is that one of our neighboring nations worship the Egyptian gods. When one of their representatives realized that we worship a god they know, the news spreaded to their capital. Now we have better diplomatic relations with that nation."

 cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME1: "Baptists settled in the New World"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC1: "In 1609, Pastor John Smyth gives birth to the Baptist movement in Holland. If this mouvement spreaded in England at first, believers crossed the Atlantic Ocean to establish their church in the New World. The first American Baptist church is based in $PROVINCENAME$, and is very successful."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT1: "I see."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME2: "Baptism Spreads"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC2: "The influence of Baptism has spread to $PROVINCENAME$ from a neighbouring province."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT2: "Fine."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME3: "The Great Awakening"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC3: "The term Great Awakening refers to several periods of religious revival in American religious history. For Baptists, it is a period of revitalization of the religious life, contributing to the formation of new churches, and allowing many people to reconnect with their faith. One of these periods is affecting our nation right now. Aware of these blessed times, candidates for the colonization of new lands are more numerous, while the fervor of our missionaries is increasing. We are ready to extend our religious influence on the world around us."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT3: "Praise the Lord!"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME4: "Gathering of Baptist congregations"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC4: "There is not one single Baptist church. Many churches have organized themselves through congregations. If their faith is identical, religious practices and Bible teachings vary depending on these congregations. However, the recent proliferation of congregations is a danger to the stability of baptism. As a consequence, it was decided to organize a Baptist convention in the capital of our nation, in an attempt to harmonize these different churches. Each congregation has sent a representative. We should know in a few days if this religious gathering will bear fruit."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT4: "I am dreading the end of this meeting..."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME5: "Baptist congregations united"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC5: "After several days of heated discussions, it appears that the various Baptist congregations have found a common ground for the majority of the topics that divided them. This is great news, because a religious unity will bring more stability in our nation. Let us hope that this sacred agreement will last in time..."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT5: "Praise the Lord!"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME6: "Baptist congregations divided"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC6: "After several days of heated discussions, it appears that the various Baptist congregations did not find any compromise. Worse: the disputes have increased. This religious convention is a bitter failure, and its impact on the faith of our people may be painful."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT6: "It is a sad day for our nation..."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME7: "Baptists settling down in a new colony"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC7: "The attempt to colonize the province of $PROVINCENAME$ is no secret. Several hundred Baptists have decided to leave their possessions to start a new life on these wild lands. The reasons for this exodus are many: some are persecuted for their faith, others seek to forget a painful past, and others have heard the call of God and want to spread baptism beyond our borders. Anyway, these new pioneers arrived, and their move should bring a faster development for our colony."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT7: "Excellent!"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME8: "A caring Baptist congregation"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC8: "Each Baptist congregation is independent, both for its organization and for the dogma that the pastors want to transmit. The province of $PROVINCENAME$ has a Baptist community whose reputation is rising up to our ears. Their faithful work for the good of the whole province, working with enthusiasm in our farms and our workshops. This influence will be very beneficial for the entire region."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT8: "That's great news!"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME9: "A fatalist Baptist congregation"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC9: "Each Baptist congregation is independent, both for its organization and for the dogma that the pastors want to transmit. The province of $PROVINCENAME$ has a Baptist community whose reputation is rising up to our ears. Their followers keep on preaching the end of times. We might think that people would give in to panic, but it is not the case: more and more people come to our officers and say they want to strengthen the ranks of our military. They want to fight to get the salvation of their souls at the Last Judgment. Maybe these scary preachings are not good news for the morale of our subjects, but they are great news for our army..."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT9: "These people panic? Good for us!"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME10: "A building Baptist congregation"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC10: "Each Baptist congregation is independent, both for its organization and for the dogma that the pastors want to transmit. The province of $PROVINCENAME$ has a Baptist community whose reputation is rising up to our ears. Their followers wish to contribute to the development of the area. Many builders and craftmen spontaneously offer help in this direction. This is the perfect time to conduct a public works policy over there... if you wish, of course."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT10: "We will definitely use their services!"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME11: "An autonomous Baptist congregation"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC11: "Each Baptist congregation is independent, both for its organization and for the dogma that the pastors want to transmit. The province of $PROVINCENAME$ has a Baptist community whose reputation is rising up to our ears. Indeed, their followers want to distance themselves from the rest of our nation. They want to live in isolation. As a consequence, we must expect that our relations with the area will become a little more delicate."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT11: "Like we needed that..."
 cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME12: "Baptism"
 cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC12: "Baptists are individuals who comprise a group of Christian denominations and churches that subscribe to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers (believer's baptism, as opposed to infant baptism), and that it must be done by complete immersion (as opposed to affusion or sprinkling). Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, pastors and deacons. Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches, though some Baptists disavow this identity."

 cpbm_canaanism.EVTNAME1: "Canaanism"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC1: "Canaanite polytheism refers to the Ancient Semitic religions practiced in the Levant from at least the early Bronze Age through the first centuries of the common era. Notably, it was the religion practiced by the ancient Phoenicians who then disseminated it throughout their coastal colonies. Native Carthaginian religion is thus included within the broader heading of Canaanism.\n\nCentral deities included: El, the most high; El's consort, Asherah; Ba'al Hadad, a storm god and the central cultic focus of later Canaanite thought; and Tanit, a lunar goddess and the patron of Carthage."
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTOPT1: "Okay"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTNAME2: "Conquest of Carthage"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC2: "Carthage is under our control! This colony, which was founded by the Phoenicians, became one of the biggest commercial, cultural and military powers of Antiquity. However, his rivalry with Rome caused his loss. Our priests have already restored the cult of Tanit, who was the protector of the city. We could seize the opportunity to rise Carthage from its ashes. This way, it would become once again the capital of one of the most powerful nations in the world!"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTOPT2: "Restoring the Carthaginian empire? Interesting."
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTNAME3: "Conquest of Phoenicia"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC3: "Sidon is under our control! These lands saw the birth of the Phoenician civilization, which occupied part of the Levant and founded numerous colonies along the Mediterranean coast. Over time, this empire has been dominated by the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Persians, the Greeks and then the Romans. Now that this region is ours, we could seize the opportunity to rise Phoenicia from its ashes. This way, Sidon would become once again the capital of one of the most powerful nations in the world!"

 cpbm_canaanism.EVTOPT5: "Okay"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTNAME6: "Tensions with Canaanites"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC6: "Our Christian nation is facing some fierce resistance in a Canaanite province. Indeed, the people of $PROVINCENAME$ still worship Phoenician gods from ancient times. They are furious that the Bible mentions one of their gods as Baalzeebub. The problem is that according to the Scriptures, Baalzeebub is one of the princes of Hell. As we refuse to rewrite the Bible to please heathens, this province is currently restless. Hopefully, they will calm down their passions shortly."
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTOPT6: "Those damn heathens..."
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTNAME7: "Building a Sanctuary"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC7: "A generous patron offers his aid to build a great sanctuary in one of our border regions. He is ready to give us the necessary funds for its construction; however, he would like the government to help supervising the work. This would mobilize a portion of our resources, but a religious monument would allow us to stabilize the region, while showing our neighbors that our gods still protect us."
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTOPT7A: "What a great initiative!"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTOPT7B: "Sorry. I prefer to invest my time on something else."
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTNAME8: "Legacy of the Phoenicians"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC8: "Our nation, like many others, are very interested in unexplored areas, where new ressources are waiting to be exploited. On the other hand, we still worship the same gods as our ancestors: the Phoenicians. They had colonies on most of the Mediterranean, and were masters in the art of colonizing new lands. Our people are galvanized by these ideas. They are prepared to cross seas and mountains, and perpetuate the colonial traditions of the Great Phoenicia."
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTOPT8: "This is excellent news!"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTNAME9: "Khnm Sacrifices"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC9: "Worshipping the Canaanite gods involves a large number of people. There is a specialized clergy composed of priests, who are called khnm. They conduct rituals for the gods. One of these priests would like to have your opinion on the rituals to perform. Most of the time, small offerings are made; but to gain the favor of the gods for sure, they want to make a much larger offering, with a lot of fruits and vetegables to feed them. We also have the ability to perform an animal sacrifice, especially since hunting has been relatively good. What is your choice?"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTOPT9A: "Bring some offerings made of vegetables."
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTOPT9B: "Let's sacrifice a few animals. I want blood!"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTOPT9C: "I do not want any sacrifice. And how do you pronounce Khnm, anyway?"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTNAME10: "The Molk"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC10: "Our nation is going through very dark days. We have been drawn into a bloody conflict, and we are losing the war. Only the gods know what our future holds if we decide to capitulate. One of our priests desperately offered to perform a sacrificial rite called molk. This ritual has been performed in ancient Carthage: it consists of sacrificing very young children to appease the god Baal, so he can grants mercy. If our soldiers know that Baal is with them, they will heroically fight on the battlefield. But is it worth sacrificing the lives of hundreds of innocent children?"
 cpbm_canaanism.EVTOPT10A: "Unfortunately, we have no choice..."

 carthage.EVTDESC2: "The collapse of Roman rule in North Africa, and the trade routes that it maintained, has greatly weakened the local economy. Now the already struggling rural communities in $PROVINCENAME$ have been hit by a famine. A curious consequence of this famine, however, has been the flowering of local Phoenician culture, as the small Phoenician towns have been much less affected by the famine and loss of trade than others."

But in this case, but you will inevitably cause damage to the hunter.

 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME4: "Pelican Spotted!"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC4: "In the midst of a religious ceremony, a majestic pelican appeared on the threshold of the church. The pelican is a very important symbol for Cathars. Indeed, in their scriptures, Jesus is compared to a 'pelican as bright as the Sun'. As a consequence, the sight of this bird reassures the faithful, who believe that the Lord is still watching over them."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT4: "Fantastic!"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME5: "Receiving the Consolamentum"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC5: "Perfects, or Perfecti, are Cathar monks who were expected to follow a lifestyle of extreme austerity and renunciation of the world, which included abstaining from eating meat and avoiding all sexual contact. By that virtue they were recognized as spiritualized angels by their followers. As such, one of their main roles was to administer the Consolamentum to the dying. However, this sacrament could also be given to the living. The oldest Perfect of the realm came to us, offering his services to administer the Consolamentum to you. By receiving this sacrament, you will also become a Perfect, meaning that the chances to have an heir will be lowered. But in return, you might receive some valuable knowledge from the Heavens."

 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME10: "Lands Donated"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC10: "Cathars are opposed to private property, especially for land use. For them, the land should belong to those who work it, and not to an owner who does not use it directly. A wealthly landowner in $PROVINCENAME$ has recently converted. He became a Good Man, and decided to give up all his possessions. We will be able to redistribute his lands to our people."

During a visit in Rome, he received a mission from the Pope: travel to the regions affected by heresy, and preach the Gospel. He decided to found a Catholic monastery in our nation to convert Cathars. Following this affront, a theological dispute is organized over several days between Dominic and one of our Cathar bishops. However, the verbal jousting takes a surprising turn: the scriptures of the two speakers are subject to the judgment of God, and are thrown into the fire. Each orator is convinced that God alone will be able to choose which scriptures to keep..."

 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC13: "The scriptures of Dominic twirl amid the flames, but remain intact. The scriptures of the Cathars are permanently lost. Although this demonstration had little effect on the population, it is a blow to the Cathars. Dominic returned to Rome, his head held high. A few years later, he founded the Dominican order, and he will be canonized after his death. But for now, this humiliation shakes our nation, and we decide to raise the papacy to the rank of historic rival."

 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC14: "Les écrits de Dominique virevoltent au milieu des flammes... mais finissent par brûler. Les écrits des Cathares sont par contre intacts. This is a blow to Dominic, but also for the papacy. Our orator has demonstrated that he was extremely wise, and joins our court. As for Dominic, only God knows the fate that Rome holds for him."

 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC16: "A troubadour (from the occitan word \"trobador\") is a composer, poet and musician from the Middle Ages. The first artists of this new genre appeared in the Occitanian territory, and were particularly appreciated by nobles. Soon, this artistic movement will spread to all of Europe, but History will remember $PROVINCENAME$ as the birthplace of the troubadours."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT16: "Fantastic! Do you think they could write a song about me?"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME17: "Catharism"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC17: "Catharism was a name most notably used as a designation for a group of dualistic sects of the later Middle Ages that thrived throughout Southern Europe, particularly northern Italy and southern France, between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries. The Cathars professed a neo-Manichaean dualism; that there are two principles, one good and the other evil, and that the material world is evil. Although the various groups emphasized different doctrines, they all agreed that matter was evil. Man was an alien and a sojourner in an evil world; his aim must be to free his spirit, which was in its nature good, and restore it to communion with God. There were strict rules for fasting, including the total prohibition of meat. Sexual intercourse was forbidden; complete ascetic renunciation of the world was called for. Under constant persecution by the Catholic Church, the Cathar hierarchy faded out in the 1270s. The heresy lingered through the fourteenth century and finally disappeared early in the fifteenth."

 cpbm_imperial.EVTNAME1: "Establishment of the Imperial Cult"
 cpbm_imperial.EVTDESC1: "Our empire is vast, and our subjects pray all kinds of gods. When the Empire rised, Augustus established the imperial cult: the idea was to encourage the people to respect the power of Rome through a deified emperor. Establishing the imperial cult would ensure more stability for our realm. We could also get more money from our followers to finance the maintenance of our provinces. In other words, we would have much to gain."
 cpbm_imperial.EVTOPT1A: "I am worthy. Let me be a god!"

 cpbm_imperial.EVTNAME4: "Dion of Prusa"
 cpbm_imperial.EVTDESC4: "Dion of Prusa, also known as Golden-mouthed because of his eloquence, is a famous Greek orator born in the province of Bithynia. His vision of politics makes him one of the most influential rhetoricians in Rome. During one of his speeches, he developed the idea that Jupiter only deals with celestial matters, and that the empereur is his representative on Earth. This position reinforces the theory that Roman emperors are linked to the gods. His words will inevitably be reflected in the imperial cult, which was originally established by Caesar and Augustus."

Tired of praying their gods in vain, people begin to turn towards their ruler. They beg you to cure this disease which kills dozens of innocents every day.

Following the trail of fish-figures painted on the walls of the city, our praetorian guard managed to stop a group of Christians. They were found guilty of thefts and fires that occurred recently in the city... even if their guilt could not have really been proven. It is time to show our people that we do not approve the presence of sectarian aberrations. You have the honor to choose how these heathens will die."

 cpbm_imperial.EVTNAME9: "Sol Invictus"
 cpbm_imperial.EVTDESC9: "The empire has serious crisis of faith. Our people is no longer interested in the old Hellenist gods, and the imperial cult itself begins to fall into disuse. To unify all the peoples of our nation, our best theologist proposed to establish the cult of Sol Invictus (meaning 'Unconquered Sun' in Latin). The Unconquered Sun is a solar deity, which incorporates aspects of the mythology of Apollo and the cult of Mithra, and certain aspects of Christianity. Sol Invictus is above all the other religions, but local cults are still authorized, whether or not they are polytheists. This deity should ensure some stability... at least from a religious point of view."

The priests of the province announced that they gathered a significant amount of money. As the emperor, this money given by your people is rightfully yours... But perhaps you would like to thank these people for their kindness?"
 cpbm_imperial.EVTOPT10A: "Good idea. We will use this money to develop the province."
 cpbm_imperial.EVTOPT10B: "Screw the peasants! I want to buy the latest toga in fashion!"

 cpbm_imperial.EVTDESC11: "Augustus is one of the most celebrated emperors by the Romans. This may be because he is one of the first deified emperors of in the imperial cult. Nevertheless, the province of $PROVINCENAME$ is particularly devoted to him. Many wealthy citizens would like to build a temple of Augustus in their capital. They are even willing to pay the entire cost of construction of the temple! However, as you are their emperor, they would like you to supervise the construction, and they would be honored if you could inaugurate the monument. What do you think ?"
 cpbm_imperial.EVTOPT11A: "That is a great initiative! I approve."
 cpbm_imperial.EVTOPT11B: "No thank you..."
 cpbm_imperial.EVTNAME12: "Concilium Provinciae"
 cpbm_imperial.EVTDESC12: "Each imperial province holds a Concilium Provinciae. Representatives of every city are gathering to worship the emperor at the provincial level. This event also helps the local elites to discuss provincial issues and send requests to Rome. This is precisely what happened in the province of $PROVINCENAME$: although our empire is in trouble, the highest citizens managed to find an acceptable compromise regarding their current problems. As a consequence, the province will be abated for a while."
 cpbm_imperial.EVTOPT12: "I am delighted to hear that!"
 cpbm_imperial.EVTNAME13: "Deification of the Emperor"
 cpbm_imperial.EVTDESC13: "Usually, Roman emperors are deified after their death. There are a few exceptions... and you are one of them! Indeed, you are perceived as a great emperor, beloved by everyone. Therefore, the people want you to be deified during your lifetime. This is the consecration of your reign over the empire. You are now one of the most famous emperors Rome has ever known, alongside Augustus and Caesar."

 cpbm_imperial.EVTOPT13B: "I can not accept this... No, I'm kidding!"
 cpbm_imperial.EVTNAME14: "Elite Praetorian Guard"
 cpbm_imperial.EVTDESC14: "The Praetorian Guard dedicates a boundless loyalty to the emperor. This guard is usually made up of elite soldiers recruited in Italy. With the rise of the imperial cult, it became the personal guard of the emperor, but also a military reserve that can turn the tide of a battle. This unit, however, arouses the jealousy of the legionaries, the latter being much less paid and have make a much longer military service. This elite guard has been dissolved and reformed many times during the history of Rome. Today, the conditions for the reassembling of this unit are met."
 cpbm_imperial.EVTOPT14A: "I want to restore this elite guard!"

 cpbm_imperial.EVTNAME15: "Sacrificium"
 cpbm_imperial.EVTDESC15: "Sacred offerings, called sacrificium, are regularly organized in order to appease the anger of the gods, or to obtain their favors. There is no precise ritual. Therefore, offerings can take many forms: it can be food, jewelry, objects specially created for the gods... Animals are sometimes sacrificed, often symbolically. Human sacrifices are rare, and often disguised as death sentences for crimes against the Empire. It is time for you to decide what the next Sacrificum organized by the priests of our capital will look like."

 cpbm_mormon.EVTNAME3: "Creation of Deseret"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC3: "When the first Mormon pioneers settled down in new lands, they expressed the wish to create their own recognized government. This was the birth of the State of Deseret, whose name derives from the term 'honeybee' mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Taking advantage of unrest in the nation, Mormon religious leaders drafted a constitution, declaring their independence. Faced with the fervor of the Mormon people, clashes between local militias and representatives of the security forces are becoming more violent. It seems now that an armed conflict is inevitable."

 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC8: "The Deseret alphabet is a phonological spelling reform which was created by the Board of Regents of the University of Deseret, under the leadership of Brigham Young. Young claimed that this alphabet was intended to replace the traditional Latin alphabet with an alternative, more phonetically accurate alphabet. However, until now, this writing has been taught only in schools and seminars. One of our advisors proposes to adopt this alphabet for good. The cost of such a change is important, because we will have to reprint our books and review all our official documents. However, in the long term, the use of our very own alphabet will reinforce the sense of belonging to a very unique and blessed nation."

In this case, the best solution would be that he integrates the governing body of our Church: the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles."

 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC13: "'Choose the right' is a motto among Mormons that is taught to children and used by members of the church as a reminder to make choices that will help an individual to live righteously. The phrase is taken from a Mormon hymn which has that title. A very talented jeweler introduced a ring with a green escutcheon bearing the letters 'CTR' in silver. This ring became a symbol of our religious affliliation. It is so successful that we now produce them in a variety of designs over thirty languages. The sales of these rings will give us prosperity for the ages to come."

This practice was very common at the beginning of mormonism, and still is among some influential Mormon families. If this idea of plural marriage has been ordained by God, it is less and less applied inside our society. As the leader of the Mormon people, it is your duty to vote on this practice. Encouraging plural marriage would promote the growth of our nation, but would offend religious minorities. On the contrary, leaving the choice to marry whoever you want would soothe tensions inside our nation."

This movement was founded by Joseph Smith in Upstate New York in the 1820s. During the 1830s and 1840s, Mormonism distinguished itself from traditional Protestantism. Mormonism today represents the new, non-Protestant faith taught by Smith in the 1840s. After Smith's death, most Mormons followed Brigham Young on his westward journey to the Utah Territory, calling themselves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Variations not a part of the LDS Church include Mormon fundamentalism, which seeks to maintain practices and doctrines such as polygamy that were abandoned by the LDS Church, and various other small independent denominations."

As a leader, you must set an example to the younger generations, so you should venture in search of your spirituality through the Outback.

 cpbm_yoruba.EVTNAME1: "The Yoruba Religion"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTDESC1: "The Yorùbá religion comprises the indigenous religion of the Yorùbá people, centered in Southwestern Nigeria and the adjoining parts of Benin and Togo. Yorùbá religious beliefs are part of Itan, the total complex of songs, histories, stories, and other cultural concepts which make up Yorùbá society. The Yorùbá hold that all human beings are expected to eventually become one in spirit with Olódùmarè (the divine creator and source of all energy). Daily life depends on proper alignment and knowledge of one's ori.\n\nOri literally means the head, but in spiritual matters it is taken to mean an inner portion of the soul that determines àyànmô (destiny) and success. Ase is the life-force that runs though all things, living and inanimate. The thoughts and actions of each person in the physical realm interact with all other living things, including the earth itself. Each person attempts to find their àyànmô in the spiritual realm. The Orishas, the divine viziers and manifestations of Olódùmarè, represent intermediary and guiding divinities."
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTOPT1: "Okay"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTNAME2: "Divination from the Babalawo"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTDESC2: "The babalawo is a Yoruba priest who is an expert in a divination system called Ifa. Through this divination, he claims to know the future by communicating with various deities, including Orunmila, the god of wisdom. The rulers of Yoruba nations consulted these priests on a regularly basis. Precisely, a babalawo came in our court. Should we take the opportunity to know our future?"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTOPT2A: "Consult the babalawo"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTOPT2B: "I do not believe in this nonsense!"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTNAME3: "Good Fortune"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTDESC3: "The babalawo agreed to consult the gods. After entering into a trance, he attests that Orunmila sees only good things for you in the coming years. It is time to announce this good news to our people."
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTOPT3: "We are blessed by the gods!"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTNAME4: "Bad Fortune"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTDESC4: "The babalawo agreed to consult the gods. After entering into a trance, he announced that Orunmila sees bad things for you in the years to come. You decided to eliminate the priest, so he would not spread that news outside the palace. Unfortunately, the people have not been fooled. Our bad fortune is now the main topic of conversation for all our subjects."
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTOPT4: "We are cursed..."
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTNAME5: "No Predicton for the Future"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTDESC5: "The babalawo agreed to consult the gods. After entering into a trance, he looked at his divination tray for a long time. However, the priest confessed that he failed to make contact with the orishas. The gods seem to ignore us, for this time anyway..."
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTOPT5: "Can we now focus on more important matters?"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTNAME6: "Advent of a new Orisha"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTDESC6: "The Yoruba religion has many deities called orishas. There are hundreds of them. Some of these deities derive from people who lived among the Yoruba, who were often warriors with a fearsome reputation. This same reputation deified them after death. This is precisely what happened after the recent death of one of our fiercest warriors: some people claim to have seen a bright light over his body, suggesting that this warrior has become a celestial being."
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTOPT6A: "Let's proclaim the good news to our people!"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTOPT6B: "His reputation must spread beyond our borders!"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTNAME7: "Recrudescence of Twins"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTDESC7: "Our Yoruba nation is at the center of all attention. Indeed, some Western researchers realized that the twin birth rate in our nation is about four times higher than in the rest of the world. They are still trying to understand why, but we know that we are simply blessed by the god of thunder Shango, who is the spiritual father of the twins in our nation. This higher birth rate will allow us to strengthen our troops, especially in the region of $PROVINCENAME$ where many twin births have been recorded recently."
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTOPT7: "Phew! I thought I was seeing double..."
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTNAME8: "Descendant of Oduduwa"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTDESC8: "At the death of Oduduwa, who was the first ruler of the Yoruba people, his descendants spread to reign over all the land our people could tread. Centuries have passed since the journey of Oduduwa towards the celestial realm, but a renowned genealogist was able to draw a direct link between the most important Orisha of all, and... yourself. Not only are you a powerful sovereign, but you also became a god in the eyes of all the Yorubas."
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTOPT8: "So, when someone asks me if I'm a god, I say yes!"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTNAME9: "Ceremonial Trance"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTDESC9: "Ceremonials have always had an important place in the Yoruba religion. During one of these ceremonies, all the participants entered a trance at the same time. The news spread from village to village, and it seems that the entire province of $PROVINCENAME$ believes that orishas contacted them. More than ever, they are ready to serve our nation for the glory, at the cost of their lives if necessary."
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTOPT9: "This is good news for our armies, and bad news for our enemies!"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTNAME10: "Moremi Ajasoro"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTDESC10: "Moremi Ajasoro was a figure of paramount importance in the history of the Yoruba people. Moremi, who was a very brave and beautiful woman, was captured and enslaved by enemy troops. She was married by force to their ruler, but she took the opportunity to escape and return to her homeland with many military secrets. Yorubas are still present in this world thanks to her. After centuries of research, we found her remains in a tomb located in a remote village. Such an important character deserves a shrine which would stand the test of time."
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTOPT10A: "We need to build this shrine in her honor!"
 cpbm_yoruba.EVTOPT10B: "Let us leave the past behind us. Only the future matters."
