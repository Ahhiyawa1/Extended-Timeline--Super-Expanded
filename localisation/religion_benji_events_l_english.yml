cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME1:0 "The Traditional Amazigh Religion"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC1:0 "It is difficult to fully reconstruct the indigenous religious beliefs of the Berber people prior to the spread of Christianity and Islam into North Africa. As an Afro-Asiatic people, mythological and linguistic comparison with the Phoenician and Egyptian cultures is helpful as well as archeological evidence found throughout North Africa. However, the majority of written evidence concerning Berber religion comes from neighboring (particularly Greek and Egyptian) sources. Additionally, some ancient Berber beliefs continue to exist within modern Berber culture, albeit significantly altered."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT1:0 "Okay"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME2:0 "Celebrating Yennayer"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC2:0 "Yennayer is the first day of the agrarian year used since antiquity by Berber people in North Africa. It corresponds to the first day of January of the Julian Calendar. This is a widespread celebration, during which some rituals take place, mostly operations of cleansing and animal sacrifices. For this year, your advisors have suggested you take an active part in preparing the celebrations. Our people would be very grateful."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT2A:0 "Join in the celebrations"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT2B:0 "I have more important things to do!"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME3:0 "The Legacy of Shoshenq I"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC3:0 "Shoshenq I was a Berber Pharaoh. He is the founder of the XXII dynasty. He is so popular among our people that his coronation has been taken as the beginning of the Amazigh calendar. Since we own Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt, we have a huge amount of prestige. This prestige can help us to improve our reputation abroad... But we could also remind the world that one of the greatest dynasties of pharaohs is of Amazigh origin. This way, we could pretend to rule over all Egyptian lands."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT3A:0 "We are the legitimate rulers of Egypt!"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT3B:0 "The whole world must be in awe of your prestige."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME4:0 "Restoring the Madghacen"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC4:0 "The Madghacen is a royal mausoleum-temple of the Berber Numidian Kings, dating from the third century BC. It is a gigantic dome ringed with columns, which is the oldest preserved ancient royal mausoleum in North Africa. However, this magnificent monument is in great danger. Damaged by the ravages of time, weather and looters, the building could collapse at any moment. It is your duty to help in the restoration of one of the greatest symbols of the Amazigh religion."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT4A:0 "We must restore this monument of our history!"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT4B:0 "Nah... These are just old stones."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME5:0 "Building a Pyramid"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC5:0 "The Berbers and their ancestors believe in life after death. At first, they buried the dead in holes on the ground. Later, they burned the bodies in tombs and burial mounds. These tombs evolved into more advanced forms such as pyramidal tombs, in which the most important personalities were buried. The people of one of our provinces would like to build one of these pyramids for you. Your reputation would stand the test of time, even after your death."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT5A:0 "I am thankful to my beloved people."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT5B:0 "I do not want to rot inside a pyramid!"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME6:0 "Tislit n Anzar"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC6:0 "Anzar is the God of heaven, waters, rivers, seas, streams, springs and rain. He is often called Aglid n Ugfur, which means \"King of the rain\". A rite known as Tislit n Anzar (The Bride of Anzar) is dedicated to him during periods of drought to rain. The province of $PROVINCENAME$ is about to organize one of these ceremonies, and would like you to be there so they will get the favors of Anzar."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT6A:0 "I want to participate in this ceremony."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT6B:0 "I wish I could, but I don't want to."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME7:0 "A Night With the Dead"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC7:0 "The cult of the dead among the Amazigh people is different from the other ancient peoples. Ancestors are deified and revered. When someone wants to invoke them to ask something, he sleeps in their graves so that their answer will be given. While you go through a bad patch, you think about the idea of spending a night among your ancestors. Do you feel ready to share your doubts with the rulers of distant past?"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT7A:0 "I am sure my ancestors will answer my call."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT7B:0 "Uh... This idea sounds a little too creepy."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME8:0 "A Night With the Dead"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC8:0 "You went into the tomb of your ancestors. It took you a long time to fall sleep, because the idea of being among deceased people did not really please you. After an endless night, you woke up without answers to your questions. However, you caught a beautiful cold because the place was cold and wet. You will be in bed for several days, but your people are grateful that you have honored their traditions."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT8:0 "Achoo!"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME9:0 "A Night With the Dead"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC9:0 "You went into the tomb of your ancestors. It took you a long time to fall sleep, because the idea of being among deceased people did not really please you. After an endless night, you woke up with the feeling of having acquired the knowledge of your ancestors. You come out of the grave smiling, ready to lead your nation to glory."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT9:0 "Fantastic!"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME10:0 "A Night With the Dead"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC10:0 "Our $MONARCHTITLE$ entered the tomb of his ancestors. However, a guard discovered that the tomb was open and believed that looters came. As a consequence, he immediately resealed the tomb, locking up our beloved leader. We realized the situation a few days later, but it was too late. Our leader is dead... But let us look on the bright side of things: we will not have to hold expensive funerals, since our leader is already resting in peace among his ancestors."
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTOPT10:0 "Fant... Wait, what do you mean by 'Our leader is dead'?"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTNAME11:0 "Affinities With Hellenism"
cpbm_amanaiism.EVTDESC11:0 "You have decided to worship a god of Hellenist origin. The good thing is that one of our neighboring nations practice Hellenism. When one of their representatives realized that we worship a god they know, the news spreaded to their capital. Now we have better diplomatic relations with that nation."

cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME1:0 "Baptists settled in the New World"
cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC1:0 "In 1609, Pastor John Smyth gives birth to the Baptist movement in Holland. If this mouvement spreaded in England at first, believers crossed the Atlantic Ocean to establish their church in the New World. The first American Baptist church is based in $PROVINCENAME$, and is very successful."
cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT1:0 "I see."
cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME2:0 "Baptism Spreads"
cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC2:0 "The influence of Baptism has spread to $PROVINCENAME$ from a neighbouring province."
cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT2:0 "Fine."
cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME3:0 "The Great Awakening"
cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC3:0 "The term Great Awakening refers to several periods of religious revival in American religious history. For Baptists, it is a period of revitalization of the religious life, contributing to the formation of new churches, and allowing many people to reconnect with their faith. One of these periods is affecting our nation right now. Aware of these blessed times, candidates for the colonization of new lands are more numerous, while the fervor of our missionaries is increasing. We are ready to extend our religious influence on the world around us."
cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT3:0 "Praise the Lord!"
cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME4:0 "Gathering of Baptist congregations"
cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC4:0 "There is not one single Baptist church. Many churches have organized themselves through congregations. If their faith is identical, religious practices and Bible teachings vary depending on these congregations. However, the recent proliferation of congregations is a danger to the stability of baptism. As a consequence, it was decided to organize a Baptist convention in the capital of our nation, in an attempt to harmonize these different churches. Each congregation has sent a representative. We should know in a few days if this religious gathering will bear fruit."
cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT4:0 "I am dreading the end of this meeting..."
cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME5:0 "Baptist congregations united"
cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC5:0 "After several days of heated discussions, it appears that the various Baptist congregations have found a common ground for the majority of the topics that divided them. This is great news, because a religious unity will bring more stability in our nation. Let us hope that this sacred agreement will last in time..."
cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT5:0 "Praise the Lord!"
cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME6:0 "Baptist congregations divided"
cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC6:0 "After several days of heated discussions, it appears that the various Baptist congregations did not find any compromise. Worse: the disputes have increased. This religious convention is a bitter failure, and its impact on the faith of our people may be painful."
cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT6:0 "It is a sad day for our nation..."
cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME7:0 "Baptists settling down in a new colony"
cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC7:0 "The attempt to colonize the province of $PROVINCENAME$ is no secret. Several hundred Baptists have decided to leave their possessions to start a new life on these wild lands. The reasons for this exodus are many: some are persecuted for their faith, others seek to forget a painful past, and others have heard the call of God and want to spread baptism beyond our borders. Anyway, these new pioneers arrived, and their move should bring a faster development for our colony."
cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT7:0 "Excellent!"
cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME8:0 "A caring Baptist congregation"
cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC8:0 "Each Baptist congregation is independent, both for its organization and for the dogma that the pastors want to transmit. The province of $PROVINCENAME$ has a Baptist community whose reputation is rising up to our ears. Their faithful work for the good of the whole province, working with enthusiasm in our farms and our workshops. This influence will be very beneficial for the entire region."
cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT8:0 "That's great news!"
cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME9:0 "A fatalist Baptist congregation"
cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC9:0 "Each Baptist congregation is independent, both for its organization and for the dogma that the pastors want to transmit. The province of $PROVINCENAME$ has a Baptist community whose reputation is rising up to our ears. Their followers keep on preaching the end of times. We might think that people would give in to panic, but it is not the case: more and more people come to our officers and say they want to strengthen the ranks of our military. They want to fight to get the salvation of their souls at the Last Judgment. Maybe these scary preachings are not good news for the morale of our subjects, but they are great news for our army..."

The province of $PROVINCENAME$ has a Baptist community whose reputation is rising up to our ears. Their followers wish to contribute to the development of the area. Many builders and craftmen spontaneously offer help in this direction. This is the perfect time to conduct a public works policy over there... if you wish, of course."

cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME11:0 "An autonomous Baptist congregation"
cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC11:0 "Each Baptist congregation is independent, both for its organization and for the dogma that the pastors want to transmit. The province of $PROVINCENAME$ has a Baptist community whose reputation is rising up to our ears. Indeed, their followers want to distance themselves from the rest of our nation. They want to live in isolation. As a consequence, we must expect that our relations with the area will become a little more delicate."
cpbm_baptism.EVTOPT11:0 "Like we needed that..."
cpbm_baptism.EVTNAME12:0 "Baptism"
cpbm_baptism.EVTDESC12:0 "Baptists are individuals who comprise a group of Christian denominations and churches that subscribe to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers (believer's baptism, as opposed to infant baptism), and that it must be done by complete immersion (as opposed to affusion or sprinkling). Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, pastors and deacons. Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches, though some Baptists disavow this identity."

cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC1:0 "Canaanite polytheism refers to the Ancient Semitic religions practiced in the Levant from at least the early Bronze Age through the first centuries of the common era. Notably, it was the religion practiced by the ancient Phoenicians who then disseminated it throughout their coastal colonies. Native Carthaginian religion is thus included within the broader heading of Canaanism.\n\nCentral deities included: El, the most high; El's consort, Asherah; Ba'al Hadad, a storm god and the central cultic focus of later Canaanite thought; and Tanit, a lunar goddess and the patron of Carthage."

cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC2:0 "Carthage is under our control! This colony, which was founded by the Phoenicians, became one of the biggest commercial, cultural and military powers of Antiquity. However, his rivalry with Rome caused his loss. Our priests have already restored the cult of Tanit, who was the protector of the city. We could seize the opportunity to rise Carthage from its ashes. This way, it would become once again the capital of one of the most powerful nations in the world!"

cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC3:0 "Sidon is under our control! These lands saw the birth of the Phoenician civilization, which occupied part of the Levant and founded numerous colonies along the Mediterranean coast. Over time, this empire has been dominated by the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Persians, the Greeks and then the Romans. Now that this region is ours, we could seize the opportunity to rise Phoenicia from its ashes. This way, Sidon would become once again the capital of one of the most powerful nations in the world!"

cpbm_canaanism.EVTNAME6:0 "Tensions with Canaanites"
cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC6:0 "Our Christian nation is facing some fierce resistance in a Canaanite province. Indeed, the people of $PROVINCENAME$ still worship Phoenician gods from ancient times. They are furious that the Bible mentions one of their gods as Baalzeebub. The problem is that according to the Scriptures, Baalzeebub is one of the princes of Hell. As we refuse to rewrite the Bible to please heathens, this province is currently restless. Hopefully, they will calm down their passions shortly."

cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC7:0 "A generous patron offers his aid to build a great sanctuary in one of our border regions. He is ready to give us the necessary funds for its construction; however, he would like the government to help supervising the work. This would mobilize a portion of our resources, but a religious monument would allow us to stabilize the region, while showing our neighbors that our gods still protect us."

cpbm_canaanism.EVTNAME8:0 "Legacy of the Phoenicians"
cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC8:0 "Our nation, like many others, are very interested in unexplored areas, where new ressources are waiting to be exploited.

cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC9:0 "Worshipping the Canaanite gods involves a large number of people. There is a specialized clergy composed of priests, who are called khnm. They conduct rituals for the gods. One of these priests would like to have your opinion on the rituals to perform. Most of the time, small offerings are made; but to gain the favor of the gods for sure, they want to make a much larger offering, with a lot of fruits and vetegables to feed them. We also have the ability to perform an animal sacrifice, especially since hunting has been relatively good. What is your choice?"
cpbm_canaanism.EVTOPT9A:0 "Bring some offerings made of vegetables."

cpbm_canaanism.EVTDESC10:0 "Our nation is going through very dark days. We have been drawn into a bloody conflict, and we are losing the war. Only the gods know what our future holds if we decide to capitulate. One of our priests desperately offered to perform a sacrificial rite called molk. This ritual has been performed in ancient Carthage: it consists of sacrificing very young children to appease the god Baal, so he can grants mercy. If our soldiers know that Baal is with them, they will heroically fight on the battlefield. But is it worth sacrificing the lives of hundreds of innocent children?"

However, this sacrament could also be given to the living. The oldest Perfect of the realm came to us, offering his services to administer the Consolamentum to you.

The Cathars professed a neo-Manichaean dualism; that there are two principles, one good and the other evil, and that the material world is evil. Although the various groups emphasized different doctrines, they all agreed that matter was evil. Man was an alien and a sojourner in an evil world; his aim must be to free his spirit, which was in its nature good, and restore it to communion with God. There were strict rules for fasting, including the total prohibition of meat. Sexual intercourse was forbidden; complete ascetic renunciation of the world was called for. Under constant persecution by the Catholic Church, the Cathar hierarchy faded out in the 1270s. The heresy lingered through the fourteenth century and finally disappeared early in the fifteenth."

However, this does not seem to be the case for those settlers who construct strange buildings on the land where we used to hunt until recently. Many councils have been organized to decide which attitude to adopt towards these beings who do not seem to respect our environment. Some recalled that we are mainly peaceful, and it would be wise to try to establish some communication with these settlers, although they seem to speak a language we do not understand. Others are more skeptical, and want to be on our guard because these individuals seem malicious. Unable to make a decision on their own, they are asking for your opinion: should we adopt a more friendly behavior, or a rather hostile one?"

cpbm_yoruba.EVTNAME1:0 "The Yoruba Religion"
cpbm_yoruba.EVTDESC1:0 "The Yorùbá religion comprises the indigenous religion of the Yorùbá people, centered in Southwestern Nigeria and the adjoining parts of Benin and Togo. Yorùbá religious beliefs are part of Itan, the total complex of songs, histories, stories, and other cultural concepts which make up Yorùbá society. The Yorùbá hold that all human beings are expected to eventually become one in spirit with Olódùmarè (the divine creator and source of all energy). Daily life depends on proper alignment and knowledge of one's ori.\n\nOri literally means the head, but in spiritual matters it is taken to mean an inner portion of the soul that determines àyànmô (destiny) and success. Ase is the life-force that runs though all things, living and inanimate. The thoughts and actions of each person in the physical realm interact with all other living things, including the earth itself. Each person attempts to find their àyànmô in the spiritual realm. The Orishas, the divine viziers and manifestations of Olódùmarè, represent intermediary and guiding divinities."

Through this divination, he claims to know the future by communicating with various deities, including Orunmila, the god of wisdom.

cpbm_yoruba.EVTDESC6:0 "The Yoruba religion has many deities called orishas. There are hundreds of them. Some of these deities derive from people who lived among the Yoruba, who were often warriors with a fearsome reputation. This same reputation deified them after death.

Centuries have passed since the journey of Oduduwa towards the celestial realm, but a renowned genealogist was able to draw a direct link between the most important Orisha of all, and... yourself. Not only are you a powerful sovereign, but you also became a god in the eyes of all the Yorubas."
